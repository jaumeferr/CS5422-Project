"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",5,Are you sure about that?,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",6,I'm betting my life on it.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",7,"Following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson, an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host, and author of Maps of Meaning, 12 rules for life, and beyond order.",170

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",10,"And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",11,Does the Yevsky wrote in the idiot spoken through the character of Prince Michigan that beauty will save the world?,115
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",12,Soldiers and actually mentioned this in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",13,What do you think the Yevsky meant by that?,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",14,Was you right?,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",15,"Well, I guess it's the divine that saves the world.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",16,Let's say you could say that by definition.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",17,"And then you might say, well, are there pointers to that which will save the world or that which eternally saves the world?",123
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",18,And the answer to that in all likelihood is yes.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",19,"And that's maybe truth and love and justice and the classical virtues, beauty, perhaps in some sense, foremost among them.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",20,"That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",21,Which direction is the arrow pointing?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",22,"Well, the arrow is pointing up.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",23,"No, I think that which it points to is what beauty points to.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",24,It transcends beauty.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",25,It's more than beauty.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",26,And that speaks to the divine.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",27,It points to the divine.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",28,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",29,"And I would say again, by definition, because we could define the divine in some real sense.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",30,So one way of defining the divine is what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.,90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",31,"And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",32,"And I would say, that's fine, but then you're just confused.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",33,Because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",34,"And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",35,"And then I'd say, well, you're just epistemologically ignorant beyond comprehension, if you think that.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",36,Because that's just not true at all.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",37,But you don't think a human being can exist within contradictions.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",38,"Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",39,"But when the contradictions make themselves manifest, it's a in confusion with regard to direction.",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",40,Then the consequence of that technically is anxiety and frustration and disappointment and all sorts of other negative emotions.,128
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",41,"But the cardinal negative emotion, signifying multiple pathways forward is anxiety.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",42,It's an entropy signal.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",43,"But you don't think that kind of entropy signal can be channeled into into beauty, into love.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",44,"Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?",59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",45,"Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be, it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity.",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",46,"Because when it's optimally structured, it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",47,"If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered, it's not acceptable.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",48,It sounds like a drum machine.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",49,It's too repetitive.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",50,It's too predictable.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",51,"It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it, along with the structure.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",52,I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus with a number of scholars.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",53,And this is a beauty discussion.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",54,"When Moses first encounters the burning bush, it's not a conflagration that demands attention.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",55,It's something that catches his attention.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",56,It's a phenomenon.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",57,That means to shine forth.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",58,And Moses has to stop and attend to it.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",59,And he does.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",60,And he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",61,"And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",62,It's a tree-like structure.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",63,It's a branching structure.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",64,It's a hierarchical structure.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",65,It's a self-similar structure.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",66,It's a fractal structure.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",67,And it's the tree of life.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",68,And it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",69,And the fire in it is the transformation that's always occurring within every structure.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",70,And the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush in that representation is an indication of the balance of transformation with structure.,140
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",71,And that balance is presented as God.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",72,And what attracts Moses to it in some sense is the beauty.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",73,"Now, it's the novelty and all that.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",74,But a painting is like a burning bush.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",75,"That's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",76,It's too much for people often.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",77,My house was and will soon be again completely covered with paintings inside.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",78,"And it was hard on people to come in there because, well, my mother, for example, say, well, why would you want to live in a museum?",132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",79,"And I think, well, I would rather live in a museum than anywhere else in some real sense.",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",80,But beauty is daunting.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",81,It scares people.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",82,"They're terrified of buying art, for example, because their taste is on display.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",83,And they should be terrified because generally people have terrible taste.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",84,"Now, that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it and develop it.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",85,"But and you know, when you put your taste on display, it's a real, it really exposes you.",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",86,Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",87,Absolutely.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",88,I am.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",89,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",90,"Well, and look how mundane that is and look how trite it is and look at how cliched it is and look at how sterile or too ordered it is or too chaotic or how quickly you start to take it for granted because you've seen it so many times.",235
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",91,"Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",92,You notice the little details.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",93,The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",94,"I mean, there are images, religious images in particular.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",95,"So we could call them deep images that people have been unpacking for four thousand years and still have an, I'll give you an example.",134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",96,This is a terrible example.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",97,So I did a lecture series on Genesis.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",98,"And I got a lot of it unpacked, but by no means all of it.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",99,"When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate to stop human beings from reentering paradise.",150
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",100,"I thought, what the hell does that mean?",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",101,Cherubim.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",102,And why do they have flaming swords?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",103,I don't get that.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",104,What is that exactly?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",105,"And then I found out from Matthew Pazzo, who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis, that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.",138
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",106,It's a very complicated idea.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",107,"And that they're partly a representation of that, which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.",100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",108,They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",109,Take your pick.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",110,Why do they have flaming swords?,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",111,"Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment and the separation of the wheat from the chaff.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",112,"I use a sword to cut away, to cut away, and to carve.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",113,"And a flaming sword is not only that, which carves, it's that, which burns.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",114,And what is it carve away and burn?,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",115,"Well, you want to get into paradise?",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",116,It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",117,And so what does that mean?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",118,"Okay, well, here's part of what it means.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",119,This is a terrible thing.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",120,So you could say that the entire Christian narrative is embedded in that image.,79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",121,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",122,"Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",123,That seems pretty obvious.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",124,Let's say further that there is a symbol of apocalypse and hell.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",125,That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",126,So here's an idea.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",127,"Not only do you have to face death, you have to face death and hell before you can get to paradise, hellish judgment, and all that's embedded in that image.",156
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",128,And a piece of art with an image like that has all that information in it.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",129,And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",130,"It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind, at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",131,"I mean, that's why people go to museums and gaze at paintings.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",132,They don't understand.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",133,And that's why they'll pay what's the most expensive objects in the world.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",134,"If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts, it's definitely classic paintings.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",135,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",136,It's high level technological implements or it's classic art.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",137,"Well, why are those things so expensive?",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",138,Why do we build temples to house the images?,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",139,Even secular people go to museums?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",140,I'm secular.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",141,"Well, are you in a museum?",26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",142,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",143,Are you looking at art?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",144,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",145,"Well, what makes you think you're secular then?",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",146,It's arguable that the thing many many centuries from now that will remain of all human civilization will be our art.,117
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",147,Not even the words.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",148,"Well, you know, a book has remained a very long time, right?",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",149,The biblical not that long of humiliation.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",150,That's right.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",151,"But that's in the full arc of living organisms, perhaps will not.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",152,"Well, we have images that are we have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old, right?",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",153,That have survived.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",154,And some of those are they're already profound in their symbolism.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",155,By we do humans.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",156,"Yeah, we found them.",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",157,"And and they've lasted, they've lasted that long.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",158,And so and then think about Europe.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",159,Seconder people all over the world make pilgrimages to Europe.,62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",160,"Well, why?",10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",161,Because of the beauty.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",162,"Obviously, I mean, that's self evident.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",163,And it's partly because there are things in Europe that are so beautiful.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",164,"They take your breath away, right?",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",165,They make your hair stand on in.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",166,They fill you with the sense of and and we need to see those things.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",167,It's not optional.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",168,We need to see those things.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",169,The cathedrals was in a cathedral in Vienna.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",170,And it was terribly beautiful.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",171,"You know, terribly beautiful.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",172,"Well, it was terribly beautiful.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",173,Is beauty painful for you?,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",174,Is is that the highest form of beauty?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",175,It really challenges you.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",176,"Oh, definitely.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",177,"Yeah, yeah, I got a good analysis of the statue of David.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",178,"MacClaindtialist says, you could be far more than you are.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",179,That's what that statue says.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",180,"And this cathedral, you know, down we went down into the under structure of it.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",181,And there were three floors of bones from the plague.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",182,And there they all are.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",183,And then that cathedral's on top of it.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",184,It's no joke to go visit a place like that.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",185,Now it's it rattlesy to the core.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",186,And our our religious systems have become propositionally dubious.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",187,"But there's no arguing with the architecture, although modern architects like to with their sterility and their giant middle fingers erected everywhere.",152
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",188,But beauty is a is a terrible pointer to God.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",189,"And you know, a secular person will say, well, I don't believe in God.",70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",190,It's like have it your way.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",191,You got it.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",192,You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon of the future except on faith.,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",193,"And you might say, well, I have no faith.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",194,"It's like, well, good luck with the future then because what are you then nihilistic and hopeless and anxiety ridden?",117
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",195,"And if not, while something's guiding you forward, it's faith in something or multiple things, which just makes you a polytheist, which I wouldn't recommend.",157
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",196,"Well, let me ask you one short lived biological meatbag to another.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",197,Who is God then?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",198,Let's try to sneak up to this question if it's at all possible.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",199,Is it possible to even talk about this?,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",200,"Well, better be because otherwise there's no communicating about it.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",201,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",202,It has to be something that can be brought down to earth.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",203,"Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",204,It's not just ignorant.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",205,"It's also sinful, right?",24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",206,So because there's not knowing and then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.,84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",207,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",208,"And so you might say, well, could you extract God from a description of the objective world?",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",209,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",210,Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",211,"And I would say, well, in a sense, there's some truth in that, but but not exactly because God in the highest sense is the spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.",171
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",212,How's that for a biological definition?,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",213,Spirit is a pattern.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",214,The spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",215,"So it's a kind of in one sense when we say the human spirit, it's that.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",216,It's an animating principle.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",217,"Yeah, it's a meta.",18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",218,It's a pattern.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",219,"And you might say, well, what's the pattern?",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",220,"Okay, well, I can tell you that to some degree.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",221,"Imagine that like your grip by beauty, your grip by admiration.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",222,So and you can just notice this.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",223,This isn't propositional.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",224,You have to notice it.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",225,It's like a hole.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",226,Turns out I admire that person.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",227,Hmm.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",228,So what does that mean?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",229,"Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",230,That's what admiration means.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",231,It means there's something about the way they are that compels imitation.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",232,Another instinct or inspires respect or awe even.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",233,"Okay, what is that that grips you?",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",234,"Well, I don't know.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",235,"Well, let's say, okay, fine, but it grips you.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",236,And you want to be like that.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",237,"Kids hero worship, for example, so do adults for that matter, unless they become entirely cynical.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",238,I worship quite a quite a few heroes.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",239,"Well, there you go.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",240,Probably.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",241,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",242,"Well, there you go.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",243,"And there's no that worship, that celebration and proclivity to imitate is worship.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",244,That's what worship means most fundamentally.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",245,Now imagine you took the set of all admirable people and you extracted out AI learning.,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",246,You extracted out the central features of what constitutes admirable.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",247,And then you did that repeatedly until you purified it to what was most admirable.,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",248,That's as good as you're going to get in in terms of a representation of God.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",249,"And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",250,"It's like, well, what do you mean?",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",251,"Yeah, it's not a set of propositional facts.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",252,It's not a scientific theory about the structure of the object of world.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",253,"And then I could say something about that too, because I've been thinking about this a lot, especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.",136
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",254,"It's like, okay, the postmodernist types going back way before Dairadan Foucault, maybe back to Nietzsche, who I admire greatly, by the way, says, God is dead.",159
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",255,"It's like, okay, but Nietzsche said, God is dead and we have killed him and we'll not find enough water to wash away all the blood.",131
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",256,So that was Nietzsche.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",257,He's no fool.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",258,He's got a way with words.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",259,He certainly does.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",260,"And so then you think, okay, well, we killed the transcendent.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",261,"Well, what does that mean for science?",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",262,"Well, it frees it up because all that nonsense about a deity is the idiot superstition that stops the scientific process from moving forward.",141
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",263,"That's basically the new atheist claim, something like that.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",264,"It's like, wait a second.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",265,Do you believe in the transcendent if you're a scientist?,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",266,"And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it, you believe in it more than anything else, because if you're a scientist, you believe in what objects to your theory, more than you believe in your theory.",211
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",267,"Now, we got to think that through very carefully.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",268,"So your theory describes the world and as far as you're concerned, your description of the world is the world.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",269,"But because you're a scientist, you think, well, even though that's my description of the world and that's what I believe, there's something beyond what I believe.",163
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",270,And that's the object.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",271,And so I'm going to throw my theory against the object and see where it'll break.,81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",272,And then I'm going to use the evidence of the break as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",273,"So as a scientist, you have to posit the existence of the ontological transcendent before you can move forward at all.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",274,"But more, you have to posit that contact with the ontological transcendent, annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart is exactly what will in fact set you free.",174
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",275,So then you accept the proposition that there is a transcendent reality.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",276,"And that the that contact with that transcend reality is redemptive in the most fundamental sense because if it wasn't, well, why would you bother making contact with it?",170
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",277,You're going to make everything worse or better.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",278,Why does the contact with the transcendent set you free as a scientist?,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",279,"Because you assume that you assume, I mean freedom in the most fundamental sense.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",280,"It's like, well, freedom from want, freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",281,That it informs you.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",282,So the logo is in it.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",283,Science.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",284,It is definitely that.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",285,"Yeah, it's the direction, let's say, the directionality of science.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",286,"That's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",287,"And then the question is, what is the narrative?",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",288,"Well, it posits a transcendent reality.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",289,It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",290,It posits that our knowledge structures should be regarded with humility.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",291,It posits that you should bow down in the face of the transcendent evidence.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",292,And you have to take a vow.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",293,You know this as a scientist.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",294,You have to take a vow to follow that path.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",295,"If you're going to be a real scientist, it's like the truth, no matter what.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",296,And that means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",297,"Well, what does redemptive mean?",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",298,"Well, why bother with science?",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",299,"Well, so people don't starve.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",300,So people can move about more effectively.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",301,"So life can be more abundant, right?",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",302,So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",303,"So the reason I was saying that while we were talking about belief in God, it's like, this is a very complicated topic, right?",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",304,Do you believe in a transcendent reality?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",305,"So, okay, now let's say you buy the argument I just made on the natural front.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",306,"You say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",307,That's not God.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",308,"And then I'd say, well, what makes you think you know what nature is?",69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",309,"Like, see, the problem with that argument is that it already presumes a materialist, a reductionist materialist objective view of what constitutes nature.",154
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",310,"But if you're a scientist, you're going to think, well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.",107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",311,I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",312,I don't know its teleology.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",313,I'm really ignorant about nature.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",314,"And so when I say it's nothing but nature, I shouldn't mean it's nothing but what I understand nature to be.",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",315,"So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account of cognitive processes?",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",316,"And the answer to that is yes, but by the time we do that, our understanding of matter will have transformed so much that what we think of as reductionists now won't look anything like what we think of reductionism now.",219
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",317,Matter isn't dead dust.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",318,I don't know what it is.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",319,I have no idea what it is.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",320,Matter is what matters.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",321,There's a definition.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",322,That's a very weird definition.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",323,"But the notion that we have, you know, that if you're a reductionist, a materialist reductionist, that you can reduce the complexity of what is to your assumptions about the nature of matter.",191
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",324,That's not a scientific.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",325,"Your specific limited human assumptions of this century, of this week that so in some sense, without God in this complicated big definition, we're talking about the there's no humility or it's not enough.",204
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",326,There's less likely to be a rather science can air in taking a trajectory away from humility.,93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",327,Without something much more powerful than individual human.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",328,"Yeah, well, then we know, you know, the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",329,That's a good story for the current times.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",330,It's like you're playing around with making new life.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",331,"You bloody well, better make sure you have your arrows pointed up.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",332,And it's interesting because you said science has an ethic to it.,65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",333,I think it's embedded in an ethic.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",334,"Well, science is a big word.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",335,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",336,And it includes a lot of disciplines that have different traditions.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",337,"So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics, those are very different communities.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",338,"And I think biology, especially when you get closer and closer to medicine into the human body, does have a very serious, first of all, it has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused and all those kinds of things.",217
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",339,"But as a history of taking this stuff seriously, what doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously is robotics and artificial intelligence, which is really interesting because you don't, you know, you called me a scientist, but and I would like to wear that label proudly, but often people don't think of computer science.",331
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",340,"But nevertheless, it will be, I think, the science of one of the major scientific fields of the 21st century.",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",341,And you should take that very seriously.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",342,"Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems, they think of them as toys to tinker with.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",343,"Oh, isn't this cool?",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",344,"Well, that I feel this too.",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",345,Isn't this cool?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",346,It is cool.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",347,"But, you know, at a certain moment, you might, isn't this nuclear explosion cool?",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",348,"Yes, it is.",11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",349,Or birth control pill cool.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",350,It's like or transistor cool.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",351,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",352,"Well, the other thing too, and this is a weird problem in some sense, the robotics engineer types, they're thing people, right?",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",353,"I mean, the big classes of interest are interesting things versus interesting people.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",354,Some of my best friends are thing people.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",355,"Yeah, right.",12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",356,"And thing people are very, very clear logical thinkers and they're very outcome oriented and practical.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",357,"Now, and that's all good.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",358,That makes the machine re and keeps it functioning.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",359,But there's a human side of the equation.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",360,"And and you get the extreme thing people and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",361,"And when we're talking about, we've been talking about the necessity of having a technological enterprise embedded in an ethic.",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",362,"And you can ignore that like most of the time, right?",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",363,You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense when you're toying around with your toys.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",364,"But when you're building an artificial intelligence, it's like, well, that's not a toy.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",365,That might be.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",366,Toys becomes the monster very cool.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",367,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",368,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",369,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",370,And this is a whole new kind of monster.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",371,And maybe it's already here.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",372,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",373,And you notice how many of those things you can no longer turn off.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",374,And what is it with you engineers and your inability to put off switches on things now?,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",375,"It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds for it to shut off.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",376,Or I can't figure it.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",377,I just want to shut it off.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",378,Click off.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",379,"Well, what is it with you humans that don't put off switches and other humans?",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",380,Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",381,And it hurts.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",382,"For both you and perhaps one day, the thing itself to turn it off.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",383,And so you have to be very careful as an engineer adding off switches to things.,80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",384,"I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",385,The off switch gives a deadline to us humans to systems of existence.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",386,"It makes you, you know, death is the thing that really brings clarity to life.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",387,And I do think hence the flaming swords.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",388,The flaming sword.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",389,I do like your view of the flame with the bush and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.,98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",390,It's also a transformation that kind of consumes the thing in the process.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",391,"Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",392,"You know, this is why you can't touch the arc of the covenant, for example.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",393,And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",394,"It's like if you're 95% deadwood and you get too close to the flame, the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.",117
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",395,"So you think it's all chap, but I think there is some aspect of destruction that is, that's, you know, the, the, the old Bukowski line of, uh, do what you love and let it kill you.",180
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",396,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",397,Don't you think that destruction is part of that's humility.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",398,That's humility.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",399,That's you bet.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",400,You bet.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",401,You bet.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",402,"It's like inviting the judgment, inviting the judgment because maybe you can die a little bit instead of dying completely.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",403,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",404,"You know, and that's, I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",405,We can let our ideas die instead of us.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",406,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",407,We can have these partial personalities that we can burn off.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",408,And we can let them go before they become tyrannical ferroes and everything.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",409,And we lose everything.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",410,"And so yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",411,And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",412,Like what if it was possible that if you died enough all the time that you could continue to live?,98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",413,"And the thing is we already know that biologically because if you don't die properly all the time, well, it's cancerous outgrowth and, and like it's a very fine balance between productivity on the biological front and the culling of that, right.",245
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",414,Life is a real balance between growth and death.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",415,And so what would happen if you got that balance right?,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",416,"Well, we kind of know, right?",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",417,"Because if you live your life properly, so to speak, and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die before it takes you out, you will live longer.",150
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",418,That's just a fact.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",419,"Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",420,And the answer is we don't know.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",421,We have no idea.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",422,"Well, let me ask you a difficult question because... As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",423,"Well, does the F-Skis always just the warm up?",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",424,"So if death, if death every single day is the way to progress through life, you have become quite famous.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",425,Death and hell.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",426,Death and hell.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",427,"Yeah, because you don't want to forget the hell part.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",428,Do you worry that your fame traps you into the person that you wore before?,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",429,"Well, it all just became an Elvis impersonator by the time you died.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",430,"Yeah, do you fear that you have become a Jordan Petersoner personator?",70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",431,"That do you fear of, in some part, becoming the famous suit-wearing brilliant Jordan Peter, the certainty in the pursuit of truth?",130
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",432,Always right.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",433,I think I worry about it more than anything else.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",434,I hope.,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",435,I hope I do.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",436,I better.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",437,Has fame to some degree when you look at yourself in the mirror in the quiet of your mind?,90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",438,Has it corrupted you?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",439,No doubt.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",440,"In some regard, I mean, it's very difficult thing to avoid, because things change around you.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",441,"People are much more likely to do what you ask, for example.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",442,"That's a danger, because one of the things that keeps you dying properly is that people push back against you optimally.",120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",443,"This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control, especially the tyrannical types that say run countries.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",444,"Everyone around them stops saying, yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.",77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",445,They laugh at all their jokes.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",446,They open all their doors.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",447,They always want something from them.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",448,The red carpets always rolled out.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",449,"It's like, well, you think, would not be lovely.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",450,"It's well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you while you're on your way to perdition.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",451,That's not a good deal.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",452,You just get there more efficiently.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",453,"And so one of the things that I've tried to learn to manage is to have people around me all the time who are critics, who are saying, yeah, I could have done that better.",170
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",454,And you're a little too harsh there.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",455,And you're alienating people unnecessarily there.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",456,And you should have done some more background work there.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",457,And I think the responsibility attendant upon that increases as your influence increases.,89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",458,"And that's as your influence increases, then that becomes a lot of responsibility.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",459,"So, you know, and then maybe have an off day.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",460,"And well, here's an example.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",461,"I've been writing some columns lately about things that perturbed me like the forthcoming famine, for example.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",462,And it's hard to take those problems on.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",463,It's difficult to take those problems on in a serious manner and it's frightening.,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",464,And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.,109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",465,And so I'm tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.,108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",466,"But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental in my tone when I'm reading such things, for example, on YouTube, then might be optimal.",137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",467,"Now, I've had debates about with people about that because I have friends who say, no, if you're calling environmentalist, globalists who are harassing the Dutch farmers, then a little anger is just the ticket.",210
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",468,"But then others say, well, you know, you don't want to be too harsh because you alienate people who would otherwise listen to you.",130
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",469,"It's like, that's a hard balance to get, right?",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",470,"But also maybe anger hardens your mind where you don't notice the subtle, quiet beauty of the world, the quiet love that's always there, the permeate everything.",161
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",471,Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",472,"It's the Nietzsche thing, battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",473,"And if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",474,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",475,But I would say bring it on.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",476,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",477,"Well, I also say, knowing that he's absolutely right, but if you gaze into the abyss long enough, you see the light, not the darkness.",134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",478,Are you sure about that?,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",479,I'm betting my life on it.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",480,That's a heck of a bet.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",481,"Well, that's because it might distort your mind to where all you see is a bis is a bis is the evil in this world.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",482,"Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",483,"You know, that's back to the you're just a limit.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",484,The sword's the flaming swords.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",485,"It's like, so I said the whole story of Christ was prefigured in that image.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",486,It's like the story of Christ psychologically is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.,98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",487,That's what it means.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",488,That's what the crucifix means.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",489,"Psychologically, it's like gaze upon that which you are most afraid of.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",490,"But that story doesn't end there because in the in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",491,So death isn't enough.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",492,"The abyss, the abyss of innocent death is not sufficient to produce redemption.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",493,It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",494,And maybe that's true for everyone.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",495,And that's like there is no more terrifying idea than that by definition.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",496,"And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",497,"Well, who knows?",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",498,Who knows?,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",499,How often do you gaze upon death your own?,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",500,"How often do you remember, remind yourself that this right ends personally?",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",501,Personally.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",502,All the time.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",503,"Because you as a deep thinker and philosopher, it's easy to start philosophizing and forgetting that you're you might die to the angel of death sits on every word.",163
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",504,How's that?,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",505,How often do you actually consciously?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",506,All the time?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",507,Notice the angel all the time.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",508,I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",509,"When I was in graduate school, you know, I thought about I was I had the thought of death in my mind all the time.",114
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",510,"And I noticed that many of the people that I was with, these were people I admired fine.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",511,That wasn't part of their character.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",512,But it was definitely part of mine.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",513,I'd wake up every morning.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",514,This happened for years.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",515,"I think time short, get out of it, time short, get out of it.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",516,There's things to do.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",517,And so that was always it's still there.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",518,And it's still there with I would say and it's unbearable in some sense.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",519,Are you afraid of it?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",520,Like what?,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",521,What's your religion?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",522,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",523,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",524,"You know, I was ready to die a year ago.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",525,And not casually.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",526,"I had people I loved, you know.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",527,"So no, I'm not very worried about me, but I am very worried about making a mistake.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",528,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",529,"Her, you know, I must talk about that a couple of months ago.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",530,It was really a striking moment.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",531,Someone asked him about death and he said just off-hand day and then went on with the conversation.,99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",532,"He said, I'd be a relief.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",533,And then he went on with the conversation.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",534,"And I thought, well, you know, he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",535,"I'm sure that part of them thinks, I'd be easier just if this wasn't here at all.",81

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",537,"So for him, that's a why live question.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",538,"The exhaustion of life, if you call it life, is suffering, but the hardship.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",539,I'm more afraid of hell than death.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",540,You're afraid of the thing that follows.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",541,I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",542,And I think we're going to find out.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",543,What's the connection between death and hell?,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",544,I don't know.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",545,I don't know.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",546,Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",547,You're more likely to die terribly if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.,83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",548,That's one connection.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",549,And terribly is as a very deep kind of concept.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",550,"Yeah, yeah.",11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",551,"And that's a definition, by the way.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",552,What do you make of Elon Musk?,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",553,You've spoken about him a bit.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",554,You met him.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",555,I struck with admiration.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",556,That's what I make of him.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",557,And I always think of that version.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",558,I always think about it as a primary.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",559,"Well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",560,"It's like, well, I laugh at him.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",561,You know what I mean?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",562,It's not propositional again.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",563,And so there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk about.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",564,The Mars venture.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",565,I don't know what he's up to there.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",566,It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",567,"Because I think, well, it'd be easier just to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",568,"Well, how much of the human endeavours absurd?",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",569,"Well, that's what it needs to say.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",570,Great man or seldom credited with their stupidity.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",571,Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",572,"I mean, obviously he's building rockets.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",573,Now he's motivated because he wants to build a platform for life on Mars.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",574,Is that a good idea?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",575,Who am I to say?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",576,"He's building the rockets, man.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",577,But I'd like to ask him about it.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",578,I would like to see that conversation.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",579,I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",580,"I think these several of his ideas like Mars, like he was becoming a multipolitical species, could be one of the things that human civilization looks back at as duh.",165
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",581,I can't believe he is one of the few people that was really pushing this idea.,78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",582,Because it's the obvious thing for society for life to survive.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",583,"Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",584,Like I would like to talk to him and find out what he's up to and why.,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",585,"But I mean, he's an impossible person.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",586,What he's done is impossible.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",587,All of it.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",588,It's like he built an electric car that works.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",589,"Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars or should it?",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",590,I don't know.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",591,"But if we're going to build electric cars, he seems to be the best at that by a lot.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",592,And he more or less did that people carve about him.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",593,But he more or less did that by himself.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",594,I know he's very good at distributing responsibility and all of that.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",595,But he's the spearhead.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",596,And then that was pretty hard.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",597,And then he built a rocket at like one tenth the price of NASA rockets.,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",598,And then he shot his car out into space.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",599,That's pretty hard.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",600,And then he's building this boring company more or less as out.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",601,What would you call it?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",602,"It's sort of it's this whimsical joke in some sense, but it's not a joke.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",603,He's amazing.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",604,And you're a link delving into the depths of the mind and starlink.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",605,It's like go Elon as far as I'm concerned.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",606,"And then you know, he puts his finger on things so oddly.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",607,The problem is underpopulation.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",608,It's like I think so too.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",609,"I think it's a terrible problem that were the West, for example, is no longer at replacement with regard to birthrate.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",610,It means we've abandoned the Virgin and the child in a most fundamental sense.,78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",611,It's a bloody catastrophe.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",612,"And Musk, he sees it.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",613,Clare's can be.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",614,"It's like, wow.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",615,"And wherever, when else is running around going, oh, there's too many people.",77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",616,"It's like, nope.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",617,Got that.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",618,Not only.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",619,"See, I've learned that there are falsehoods and lies and there are anti-truths.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",620,And an anti-truth is something that's so preposterous that you couldn't make a claim that's more opposite to the truth.,119
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",621,And the claim that there are too many people on the planet is an anti-truth.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",622,"So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept limits to growth and it's like, I have to accept the limits that you're going to impose on me because you're frightened of the future.",185
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",623,"That's your theory, isn't it?",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",624,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",625,"Well, it's an idea.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",626,It could be a right idea.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",627,It could be a wrong idea.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",628,I don't think anti-truth.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",629,"I'll hear I'll tell you why it's a wrong idea, I think.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",630,So imagine that there's an emergency dragon.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",631,There's a dragon.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",632,"Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",633,I'm the guy to deal with it.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",634,That's what the environmentalists say.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",635,The radical types who push limits to growth.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",636,"Then I look at them and I think, okay, is that dragon real or not?",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",637,That's one question.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",638,"Well, I ask that question on myself every time.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",639,I spend time alone.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",640,Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",641,"Yes or no, I'll just leave that aside for the time being.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",642,I think you can make a case both ways for a bunch of different reasons.,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",643,And it's not a trivial concern.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",644,And we've overfished the oceans terribly.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",645,And there are environmental issues that are looming large.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",646,"Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not is a whole different question, but we won't get into that.",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",647,That's not the issue.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",648,You're clamoring about a dragon.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",649,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",650,Why should I listen to you?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",651,"Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",652,"First of all, you're scared stiff and in the state of panic.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",653,That might indicate you're not the man for the job.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",654,"Second, you're willing to use compulsion to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",655,"So now, not only are you terrified, you're a terrified tyrant.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",656,"So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.",107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",657,And maybe that's a neurological explanation.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",658,"It's like if you're so afraid of what you're facing, that you're terrified into paralysis and nihilism and that you're willing to use tyrannical compulsion to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.",215
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",659,So then I like someone like Bjorn Longberg or Matt Ridley or Mary and Tupi.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",660,"And they say, well, look, we've got our environmental problems.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",661,And maybe there's a there you could make a case that there's a Malthusian element in some situations.,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",662,"But fundamentally, the track record of the human race is that we learn very fast and faster all the time to do more with less.",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",663,And we've got this.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",664,"And I think, yes, to that idea.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",665,And I think about it in a in a fundamental way.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",666,"It's like a trust Longberg, trust Tupi, trust Matt Ridley.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",667,They thought about these things deeply.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",668,"They're not just saying, oh, the environment doesn't matter whatever the environment is, you know, the environment.",115
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",669,I don't even know what that is.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",670,That's everything.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",671,The environment.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",672,I'm concerned about the environments like which is how is that different than saying I'm worried about everything?,114
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",673,How are those statements different semantically?,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",674,"Well, yeah, the environment, it could be I'm worried about human society.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",675,A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about because there's so much involved for sure.,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",676,"Yeah, everything.",17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",677,"And then these models, because people have gone after me, because I don't buy the climate models, well, I think about the climate models as extended into the economic models.",174
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",678,"Because the climate model is, well, there's going to be a certain degree of heating, let's say, by 2100.",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",679,"It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",680,Some of it's a consequence of warming after the ice age.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",681,"This has happened before, but fair enough, let's take your presumption.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",682,"Although there are multiple presumptions and any error in your model multiplies as time extends, but to have it your way.",121
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",683,"Okay, now we're going to extend the climate model so to speak into the economic model.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",684,So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",685,"Third biggest company in the US, 300,000 employees, major league consultants, they just produced a report in May.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",686,"I wrote an article for it in the telegraph, which I'm going to release this week on my YouTube channel, said, well, if we get the climate problem under control economically, because that's where the models are now being generated on the economic front.",252
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",687,So now we have to model the environment.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",688,"That's climate, and we have to model the economy.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",689,"And then we have to model their joint interaction, and then we have to predict 100 years into the future, and then we have to put a dollar value on that, and then we have to claim that we can do that, which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.",249
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",690,"We're going to go through a difficult period of privation, because if we don't accept limits to growth, there's going to be a catastrophe, 50 years in the future, thereabouts.",175
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",691,"And so to avert that catastrophe, we are going to make people poorer now.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",692,How much poorer?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",693,"Well, not a lot compared to how much richer they're going to be, but definitely, and they say this in their own models, definitely poorer, definitely poorer, then they would be if we just left them the hell alone.",213
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",694,"And so then I think, okay, poorer, a who?",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",695,"Well, let's look at it biologically.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",696,"Got a hierarchy, right?",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",697,Of stability and security.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",698,That's a hierarchy or one type.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",699,"You stress a hierarchy, like that, a social hierarchy.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",700,"So there's birds in a environment, and an avian flu comes in, and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy, and the low ranking birds have the worst nests, so they're most exposed to wind and rain and sun, and farthest from food supplies and most exposed to predators.",278
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",701,"And so those birds are stressed, which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.",91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",702,"You're more stressed, because your life is more uncertain.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",703,"You're more stressed, your immunological function is compromised because of that.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",704,You're sacrificing the future for the present.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",705,"An avian flu comes in, and the birds die from the bottom up.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",706,That happens in every epidemic.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",707,You die from the bottom up.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",708,"Okay, so they say when the aristocracy counts as a cold, the working class dies of pneumonia.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",709,"All right, so now we're going to make people poorer.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",710,"Okay, who?",10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",711,"Well, we know who we make poor, when we make people poorer.",59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",712,"We make those who are barely hanging on, poorer, and what does that mean?",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",713,It means they die.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",714,"And so what the deloitte consultants are basically saying is, well, you know, it's kind of unfortunate, but according to our models, a lot of poor people are going to have to die, so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future.",235
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",715,"It's like, okay, hold on a sec, which of those two things am I supposed to regard with certainty?",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",716,"The hypothetical poor people that you're going to hypothetically save 100 years from now, or the actual poor people that you are actually going to kill in the next 10 years.",173
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",717,"Well, I'm going to cast my law with the actual poor people that you're actually going to kill.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",718,"And so, and then I think further, it's like, well, okay, the deloitte consultants, have you actually modeled the world?",119
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",719,"Or is this a big advertising stick designed to attract your corporate clients with the demonstration that you're so intelligent that you can actually model the entire ecosystem of the world, including the economic system, and predict it 100 years forward?",255
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",720,And isn't there a bit of a moral hazard in making a claim like that?,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",721,"Just like just a trifle, especially when, so I talked to Bjorn Lomburg and Michael Yon last week.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",722,"I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year, 150 million people will suffer food insecurity, food insecurity.",124
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",723,"Yeah, food insecurity.",22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",724,That's the bloody buzzword.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",725,"Famine, well, Michael Yon thought 1.2 billion.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",726,"And then that it'll spiral because he said, what happens in a famine is that the governments go nuts crazy, the governments destabilize, and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.",189
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",727,Then the farmers don't have any money.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",728,Then they can't grow crops.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",729,"And I think, yeah, that's exactly what they do.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",730,That's exactly what would happen.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",731,And so Yon told me 1.2 billion.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",732,And then Bjorn Lomburg said the same thing.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",733,I didn't even ask him.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",734,He just made it as an offhand comment.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",735,So let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",736,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",737,Do you think you crane in the Ukraine?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",738,"Oh, yeah.",9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",739,"Fun, fun, fun.",14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",740,"Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned in the last few sentences, kind of echo through that part of human history.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",741,The hall door.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",742,Do you know what news about?,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",743,"Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",744,"There's different parts of the world that's still, even if they don't know, they know.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",745,"Yeah, right.",12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",746,"If you history is runs in the blood, the Dutch knew in some sense, they had a famine at the end of World War 2.",111
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",747,And part of the reason the Dutch farmers are so unbelievably efficient and productive is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War 2 that that was not going to happen again.,176
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",748,"And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean because Holland, that's quite a country.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",749,It shouldn't even exist.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",750,"In fact, that it's the world's number two exporting.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",751,"You know, that's the world's number two exporter of agricultural products.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",752,Holland.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",753,"It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",754,It's this little tiny place.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",755,It shouldn't even exist.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",756,"And they want to put, here's the here's the plan.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",757,Let's put 30% of the farmers out of business.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",758,"Well, the broader ecosystem of agriculture production in Holland is 6% of their GDP.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",759,"Now, these centralizing politicians think, tell me if I'm stupid about this.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",760,Take an industry.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",761,You knock it back by theat by 30%.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",762,"Now, it runs on like a 3% profit margin.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",763,"Now, you're going to kill 30% of it.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",764,"How are you not going to bring the whole thing down, the whole farming ecosystem down?",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",765,How are you not going to empower the transport systems?,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",766,How are you not going to demolish the grocery stores?,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",767,You can't take something like that and pair it back by theat by 30%.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",768,And not kill it.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",769,I can't see how you can do that.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",770,"I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",771,We broke the supply chains.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",772,"If tried buying something lately, you can't and wait and aren't the Chinese threatening Taiwan at the moment?",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",773,What are we going to do without chips?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",774,So I don't know what these people are thinking.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",775,"And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",776,"Well, the Deloitte people are thinking, aren't we smart and shouldn't we be hired by our corporate employers?",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",777,"It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",778,What are the environmentalists thinking?,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",779,We love the planet.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",780,"It's like, do you?",18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",781,We love the poor.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",782,Do you?,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",783,"Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",784,Who wins the planet?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",785,"Okay, you don't love the poor that much.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",786,Do you love the planet?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",787,Or do you hate capitalism?,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",788,Let's pit those two things against each other.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",789,"Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",790,How can we tell?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",791,Because you're willing to break it.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",792,And you know what's going to happen?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",793,So what's going to happen in Sri Lanka with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?,96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",794,Are they going to eat all the animals?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",795,Are they going to burn all the firewood?,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",796,They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",797,"It's like, so is your environmental globalist utopia going to kill the poor and destroy the planet?",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",798,And that's okay because we'll wipe out capitalism.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",799,"It's like, okay.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",800,"Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world, some of which can destroy that world.",140
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",801,"Now, what do you think of that theory about about trustworthiness?",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",802,"If the dragon that you're facing turns you into a terrified tyrant, you're not the man for the job.",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",803,Is that a good theory?,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",804,It's an interesting theory.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",805,Let me use that theory to challenge because what does terror look like?,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",806,Let me me.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",807,Table the turns.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",808,Turn the tables on you.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",809,"You are terrified, afraid, concerned about the dragon of something we can call communism, Marxism.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",810,My terrified of it?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",811,"Well, okay.",11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",812,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",813,Your theories had two components.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",814,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",815,I'm not paralyzed at a dragon.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",816,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",817,I'm not paralyzed and I don't want to be a tyrant.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",818,"The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",819,So you are very concerned.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",820,The intensity of your feeling does not give much space.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",821,"Actually, at least in your public persona for sitting quietly with the dragon and sipping in a couple of beers and thinking about this thing.",141
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",822,"The intensity of your anger, concern about certain things you're seeing in society.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",823,Is that going to drive you off the path that ultimately takes a still better world?,83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",824,That's a good question.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",825,"I mean, I'm trying to get that right.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",826,So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion about the Nazis.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",827,Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",828,Seems the answer to that is yes.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",829,"Well, actually, let me push back here.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",830,I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",831,I mean the actual Nazis.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",832,"Well, as you know, there's a lot of people in the world that use actual Nazis to meet a lot of things.",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",833,I know.,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",834,"One of them is very important to me, for example.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",835,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",836,"I think our magical super Nazi, as it turns out.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",837,I think to actually sort of steal men all their perspectives.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",838,I think a lot of people that call you Nazi mean it.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",839,"So, but like, there's an important thing there, because I went to the front in Ukraine.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",840,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",841,"And a lot of the people that lost their home or there kind of that got to interact a lot with Russian soldiers, Ukrainian people that interacted with Russian soldiers, they reported that the Russian soldiers really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine in these local villages from the Nazis.",299
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",842,I understand.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",843,"So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government has or Ukraine has some Nazis.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",844,"It's like, it has been the ideas that the Nazis have taken over Ukraine, and we need to free them.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",845,This is the belief.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",846,"So this, again, Nazis still a dragon that lives and it's used by people because it's safe to sit next to that dragon and spread any kind of ideology you want.",158
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",847,"So I just want to kind of say that we have agreed on the on this particular dragon, but I still don't trust anybody who uses that.",130
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",848,"Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",849,"No, no, it's so this is a very complicated problem, right?",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",850,So Renasierard believed that it was a human proclivity to demonize the scapegoat and then drive it out of the village.,118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",851,I've thought about that a lot.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",852,We need a place to put Satan.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",853,"Seriously, this is a serious issue.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",854,Should we be inside the villager outside?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",855,"Well, maybe she should be inside you.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",856,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",857,That's that's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",858,"It's like, Satan is best fought on the battleground of your soul.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",859,And that's that's right.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",860,It's right.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",861,Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon that you're fighting?,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",862,Is it is it is a communism?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",863,It's the spirit of can.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",864,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",865,Can you elaborate?,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",866,"Well, what the spirit of can is.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",867,"So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise for becoming self-conscious or when they become self-conscious, they're destined to work.",138
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",868,And the reason for that as far as I can tell is that to become self-conscious is to become aware of the future.,111
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",869,It's to become aware of death.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",870,That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story to have the scales fall from your eyes.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",871,And then the consequence of that is that you now have to labor to prevent the catastrophes of the future.,105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",872,That's work.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",873,Work is sacrifice.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",874,Sacrifice of the present to the future.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",875,It's delay of gratification.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",876,It's maturity.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",877,It's sacrifice to something as well and in the spirit of something.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",878,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",879,So now Adam and Eve have two children can enable.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",880,So those are the first two people in history because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.,86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",881,And they're the first two people who are born rather than created.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",882,So they're the first two people.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",883,"And that's a hell of a story because it's a story of Fratricidal murder that degenerates into genocide, flood and tyranny.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",884,"So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say, enable in Cain, both make sacrifices.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",885,"And for some reason, able sacrifices, please God.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",886,It's not exactly clear why and Cain's don't.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",887,Now there's an implication in the text that it's because Cain's sacrifices are true or second rate.,99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",888,God says that able brings the finest to the sacrificial altar.,62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",889,He doesn't say that about Cain.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",890,"So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away, but he's holding something in reserve.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",891,He's not all in.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",892,He's not bringing his best to the table.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",893,He's not offering his best to God.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",894,And so able thrives like mad.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",895,And everyone loves him.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",896,"And he gets exactly what he needs and wants, exactly when he needs and wants it.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",897,He's favored of God.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",898,And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward and working.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",899,And his sacrifices are rejected.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",900,"So he gets resentful, really resentful, enough resentful enough to call God out and say something like, this is quite the creation you've got going here.",153
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",901,I'm breaking myself in half and nothing goods come in my way.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",902,What the hell's up without?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",903,And then there's able the sun shining on him every day.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",904,How dare you?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",905,"Okay, but this is God that Cain's talking to you.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",906,"And so God says what Cain least wants to hear, which is what God usually says to people.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",907,"He says, look to your own devices.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",908,You're not making the sacrifices you should.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",909,And you know it.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",910,And then he says something even worse.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",911,"He says, sin.",13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",912,"Crouches at your door, like a sexually aroused predatory animal.",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",913,"And you've invited it in to have your way, to have its way with you.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",914,"And so he basically says, you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",915,And now you're brooding upon it and generating something creative new and awful possessed by the spirit of resentment.,118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",916,And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",917,So then Cain leaves his countenance falls as you might expect in Cain leaves.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",918,"And he's so insensed by this because God has said, look, your problems are of your own making.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",919,"And not only that, you invited the man.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",920,"And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",921,"And not only that, you're blaming it on me.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",922,"And not only that, that's making you jealous of able who's your actual idol and goal.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",923,And Cain instead of changing kills able.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",924,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",925,And then Cain's descendants are the first people who make weapons of war.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",926,And so that's okay.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",927,You want to know what I think?,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",928,That's the eternal story of mankind.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",929,"And it's playing out right now, except at a thousand times the rate.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",930,Can I present to you a difficult truth?,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",931,"Not perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have that it is not always easy to know which among us are the Cain.",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",932,That's for sure.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",933,And resentment.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",934,It is possible to imagine you as the person who has a resentment towards a particular worldview that you really worry about.,124
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",935,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",936,"Well, I've talked I talked to a good friend of mine last week about that publicly.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",937,"Well, we'll release it.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",938,"So I said, well, do I have a particular animus against the left?",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",939,"Let's say it's like, well, probably.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",940,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",941,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",942,"Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",943,It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",944,They're threatened by the left.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",945,100% and they're not just threatened a little bit.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",946,They're threatened a lot.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",947,And that threat made it impossible for me to continue in my profession the way I was.,85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",948,And it cost me my clinical practice too.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",949,"And that's not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits against me out right now from the College of Psychologists because they've allowed anyone to complain about me anywhere in the world for any reason and have the choice to follow that up with an investigation, which is a punishment in and of itself and are doing so.",316
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",950,And then I've been tortured nearly to death multiple times by bad actors on the left.,85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",951,Now I've had my fair share of radical right wingers being unhappy with what I've said.,86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",952,"But personally, that's been the left the whole time.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",953,"Not only me, but my family put my family at risk in a big way and constantly like not once or twice because many people get canceled once or twice.",147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",954,But I've been canceled like 40 times.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",955,And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",956,And I can tell you without doubt that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",957,And that's if it only happens once.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",958,And so and then I also know that the communists killed 100 million people in the 20th century that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop and still haven't quit that almost no one knows about it.,202
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",959,And that the specter of resentful Marxism is back in full force.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",960,And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",961,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",962,Does it go too far?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",963,I don't know.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",964,I'm trying to figure that out.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",965,The story you just told it is seems nearly impossible for you.,62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",966,An intellectual powerhouse not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",967,"Well, and this is the so let me challenge you.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",968,"Yeah, go right ahead.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",969,Challenge you.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",970,Can you steal man?,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",971,"The case that the prime minister of this country, Trudeau, wants the best for this country and actually might do good things for this country as an intellectual challenge.",171
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",972,Sure.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",973,"Um, he seems to get along well with his wife.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",974,He has some kids.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",975,There's no sexual scandals.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",976,And he's in a position where that could easily be the case.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",977,He seems to have done some good things on the oceanic management front.,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",978,He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans into marine protected areas.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",979,And that might be his most fundamental legacy.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",980,"If it's real, I've been trying to get information about the actual reality of the protection.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",981,And I haven't been able to do that.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",982,But that's a good thing.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",983,So sorry to the family thing is there's some aspect of his character.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",984,This is a character.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",985,There is some aspect to him who's that makes him a good man.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",986,"Well, I mean, there's the evidence there.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",987,"You know, I mean, he's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate on the sexual front.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",988,So that's something.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",989,"And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",990,And he has kids.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",991,"So, you know, good for him.",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",992,"That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",993,"Yeah, right.",12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",994,To be a great man.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",995,"Well, then I also thought, okay, well, after the Liberals had brought in a Harvard intellectual who was a Canadian to be their last leader, he didn't work out.",159
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",996,And then they're flailing about for a leader.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",997,And the Liberals in Canada are pretty good at maintaining power and leadership and have been the dominant governing party in Canada for a long time.,148
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",998,"And so they went to Justin and said, well, you know, it's you are a conservative.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",999,"And you can imagine that's not a positive, um, specter for someone who's on the left.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1000,"Or even a liberal, especially, and Trudeau is quite a bit on the left.",70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1001,"And they said, we need you to run.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1002,"And then I thought, okay, well, the answer to that should have been no because the Trudeau Justin has no training for this, no experience.",138
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1003,"He's not, he's a part-time drama teacher, fundamentally.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1004,He hadn't run a business.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1005,He just didn't know enough to be prime minister.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1006,But then I'm trying to put myself in his position.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1007,"And so it's like, okay, I don't know enough, but I'm young.",59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1008,And we don't want the conservatives.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1009,And they had had to run a 10-year run.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1010,So maybe it was time for a new government.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1011,"I could, maybe I could grow into this man.",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1012,Maybe I could surround myself with good people and I could learn humbly.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1013,"And I could become the person I'm now pretending to be, which we all have to do as we move forward, right?",106
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1014,"And so, and so then I thought, okay, I think you made a mistake there because you ran only on your father's name.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1015,And you didn't have the background.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1016,But let's give the devil his due and say that's no problem.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1017,"Okay, so now what do you do?",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1018,"Well, you get elected, and your first act is to make the cabinet 50% women, despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members are female.",141
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1019,"It's like, okay, you just have to your talent pool.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1020,That was a really bad move for your first move.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1021,"Okay, I can ask you about that.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1022,"Do you think, where does that move come from?",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1023,Deep somewhere in the heart?,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1024,Or is it is it trying to listen to the social forces that of the moment and try to ride those ways?,99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1025,"You know, maybe it's like a great, a great popularity.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1026,"By, after thinking it through, it's like, no, you just have your talent pool for cabinet positions.",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1027,That's what you did.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1028,There's enough cabinet positions.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1029,"You know, you could argue that each of the met threshold, it's like, there's a big difference between threshold and excellent.",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1030,So you don't think that that came from a place of compassion.,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1031,I don't care about it.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1032,I don't regard compassion as a virtue.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1033,"Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1034,You don't think you're vicious compassion is a virtue.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1035,"Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1036,"Compassion can come deep from the human heart and the human mind, I think.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1037,Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1038,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1039,Trying to understand the suffering.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1040,Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1041,I see.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1042,"Well, compassion isn't treating adults like inf, I mean, those are just terms.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1043,Are you sure?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1044,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1045,"Whatever the term is, maybe love is maybe the better.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1046,Edible compassion is.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1047,"I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1048,You don't think those ideas came from concern.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1049,Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1050,"Love is complicated, man.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1051,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1052,"If I love you, if I love you, is it compassion or encouragement you want from me?",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1053,"Yeah, the dance.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1054,"Well, love is definitely a dance of two humans, ultimately, that leads to the growth of both.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1055,"Well, that's the thing.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1056,The growth element is crucial.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1057,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1058,"Because the growth element to foster the growth element, that requires judgment.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1059,"Compassion and judgment, well, even and have been conceptualized this way forever, two hands of God, mercy and justice.",119
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1060,"They have to operate in tandem, right?",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1061,And mercy is flawed as you are.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1062,You're acceptable.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1063,"It's like, well, do you want that?",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1064,Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1065,And that's that is no.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1066,"It's so it's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1067,"It's like, but you could be better.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1068,You could be more than you are.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1069,And that's the maternal and the paternal in some fundamental sense.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1070,And there has to be an active exchange of information between those two poles.,78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1071,"So even if even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion, it's like, yeah, just how loving are you?",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1072,"First of all, no, it was a really bad decision.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1073,And then he and he's expressed contempt for monetary policy.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1074,I'm not interested in monetary policy.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1075,"It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1076,And he's expressed admiration for the Chinese Communist Party because they can be very efficient in their pursuit of environmental goals.,137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1077,"It's like, oh, yeah, efficiency, eh?",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1078,The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1079,"And so, and I've watched him repeatedly and I've listened to him a lot and I've tried to do that clinically and with some degree of dispassion.",143
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1080,"And that's hard too because his father, Pierre, devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1081,And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1082,"And so as a Westerner as well, I have an inbuilt animus and one that's well deserved because central Canada, especially the glittery, literati elite types in the Ottawa Montreal Toronto triangle have exploited the West and expressed contempt for the West far too much for far too long.",285
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1083,"And that's accelerating at the moment, for example, with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1084,He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1085,"It's an utter absolute bloody catastrophe and look what's happened in Europe, at least in partial consequence.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1086,And he's no friend to the farmers.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1087,"So I've tried to steal manhem, you know, I try to put myself in the position of the people that I'm criticizing.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1088,I think he's a narcissist.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1089,Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1090,"If you're not suited for the position, if you're not the man for the position, you can be absolutely 100% sure that the power will corrupt you.",143
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1091,How could it not?,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1092,"I mean, at the least, if you don't have the chops for the job, you have to devalue the job to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.",149
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1093,"So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1094,"And I mean, look at him doubling down.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1095,We wear masks in flights into Canada.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1096,We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.,103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1097,We can't get a passport.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1098,What if you're 85 and you don't know how to use the smartphone?,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1099,"Oh well, too bad for you.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1100,"It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1101,Would you talk to him?,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1102,"Well, if you were to sit down and talk with him and he wanted to talk, would you and what kind of things would you talk about?",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1103,Perhaps on your podcast?,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1104,I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1105,"So which is, you know, would you would that be a first or would you would you make that conversation?",101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1106,"Do you believe in the power of no, I'd ask them those kinds of contact?",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1107,"No, if if if if he was willing to talk to me, I'd talk because I'd like to ask him, I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.",132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1108,"I mean, I've had political types in Canada on my podcast and tried to ask them questions.",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1109,So I'd like to know.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1110,Is that something?,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1111,Maybe I've got a big part of them wrong.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1112,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1113,And I probably do.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1114,"But my observation has been that every chance he had to retreat from his phoenix position, let's say he doubled down and these are parliament is not running for the next year.",175
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1115,It's still zoom in.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1116,It's still COVID lockdown parliament for the next year.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1117,It's already been fatally compromised perhaps by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.,92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1118,And this is parliament we're talking about.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1119,"There's a kind of paralysis, fear driven paralysis that also in part, so some of the most brilliant people I know are lost in this paralysis.",141
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1120,"I don't think people have signed a word to it, but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing that lurks in the shadows and that unfortunately that fear is leveraged by people that who are in academic circles, who are in faculty or students, this is a lot more administration.",279
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1121,"And they start to use that fear, which makes me quite uncomfortable.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1122,It does lend people in the positions of power who are not good at handling that power to become slowly day by day a little bit more corrupt.,140
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1123,I was really trying to figure out the last two weeks thinking this through.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1124,"It's like how do you know let's say someone asked me a question in the YouTube comments, they said, well why can I trust your advice on the environmental front?",160
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1125,"And I thought, that's a really good question.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1126,"Okay, let's see if we can figure out the principles by which the advice would be trustworthy.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1127,"Okay, how do you know it's not trustworthy?",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1128,"Well, one potential response to that would be the claims are not in accordance with the facts, but you know, facts are tricky things and it depends on where you look for them.",175
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1129,"So that's a tough one to get right because for example, Longberg's fundamental critics argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1130,So that can't be an unnearing guide.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1131,"And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work because when it's about everything, there's too many facts.",114
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1132,So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1133,Because that's really the question.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1134,And the answer is they're not terrified tyrants.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1135,I think that's the answer.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1136,"Now, maybe that's wrong.",24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1137,"If someone has a better answer, I didn't know if they're terrified tyrant because they are willing to use compulsion on other people when they could use goodwill.",162
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1138,"Like the farmers in Canada objected, they said, look, we have every economic reason to use this little fertilizer as we can because it's expensive.",147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1139,We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1140,We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially in the last 40 years.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1141,You can't believe it.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1142,And we grow way more food.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1143,We're already breaking ourselves in half.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1144,"And if you know farmers, especially the ones who still survive, you think you think those people don't know what they're doing.",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1145,"It's like they're pretty damn sophisticated, man, like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1146,"And now you tell them, no, it's a 30% reduction.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1147,And we don't care how much food you're growing.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1148,"So it's not a reduction that's dependent on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used, which would be at least you could imagine it.",142
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1149,"So okay, so you're producing this much food and you use this much fertilizer.",77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1150,So you're hyper efficient.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1151,Maybe we take the 10% of farmers who are the least efficient in that metric.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1152,"And we say to them, you have to get as efficient as the average farmer.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1153,"And then they say, well, look, you know, our situation's different.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1154,"We're in a more northern climb, the soils weaker.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1155,"You know, you obviously have to bargain with that.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1156,"But at least, at least you reward them for their productivity.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1157,"Well, it's like, well, Holland isn't going to have beef.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1158,"Well, where are they going to get it?",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1159,"Well, you don't need it.",24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1160,"It's like, oh, I see.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1161,You get to tell me what I can eat now.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1162,Do you?,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1163,Really?,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1164,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1165,And Holland is going to import food from where that's more efficient on the fertilizer front.,93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1166,There's no one more efficient than Holland and same with Canada.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1167,"And like, isn't this going to make food prices more expensive?",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1168,And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1169,Because that is what it means.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1170,So ultimately poor people pay the price of these kinds of policies.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1171,"Not known, not ultimately.",26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1172,"Now today, today, that's a crucial distinction because they say, well, ultimately, the poor will benefit.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1173,"Yeah, except the dead ones.",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1174,"Today, today, right?",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1175,"It seems like the story of war, too, is a time when the poor people suffer from the decision made by the powerful, the rich, the political elite.",145
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1176,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1177,Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1178,"Oh, yeah.",9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1179,I got into plenty of trouble about that too.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1180,"You're, you're just a man in a suit talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1181,"There's also people dying, fighting.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1182,"It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1183,This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1184,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1185,"It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons and they're asking themselves a question, who are we?",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1186,What is this?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1187,What is the future of this nation?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1188,We thought we are a great nation.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1189,"And I think both countries say this and they say, well, how do we become the great nation we thought we are?",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1190,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1191,"And so what, first of all, you got in trouble, what's the dynamics of the trouble?",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1192,And is that what you regret saying?,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1193,"No, no, I thought about it a lot.",33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1194,I laid out four reasons for the war.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1195,"And then I was criticized in the Atlantic for the argument was reduced to one reason, which was a caricature of the reason I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.",172
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1196,Mismanagement on the part of the West in relationship to Russia and foreign policy over the last since the wall fell.,117
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1197,It's understandable because it's extremely complex.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1198,Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy provision for Europe in the wake of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.,133
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1199,The expansionist tendencies of Russia that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet Union empire building.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1200,"And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for, which is Putin's belief or willingness to manipulate his people into believing that Russia is a salvific force in the face of idiot western wokeism.",210
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1201,And that's the one I got in trouble for.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1202,"It's like, while you're justifying Putin, it's like, it's not only the Russians that think the West has lost its mind.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1203,The Eastern Europeans think so too.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1204,And do I know that?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1205,"It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries this spring.",69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1206,And I talked to 300 political and cultural leaders.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1207,"And you might say, well, they were all conservatives.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1208,"It's like, actually, no, they weren't.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1209,"Most of them were conservatives because it turns out that they're more willing to talk to me, but a good chunk of them were liberals by by any stretch of the imagination.",170
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1210,And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1211,"Well, because you're very concerned about the culture wars that perhaps are a signal of a possible bad future for this country and for this part of the world, that reason stands out.",182
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1212,"And do you sort of looking back at four reasons, think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1213,"Oh, absolutely.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1214,"Because it is, you know, it's a confidated day because I said, look, Putin might believe this.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1215,"And I actually think he does, because I read a bunch of Putin speeches and I have been reading them for 15 years.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1216,"And my sense of people generally, and this was true Hitler, it's like, what did Hitler believe?",95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1217,"Well, did you read what he wrote?",33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1218,He just did what he said he was going to do.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1219,"And you might think, well, some people are so tricky.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1220,They have a whole body of elaborated speech that's completely separate from their personality and their personality is pursuing a different agenda.,147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1221,And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1222,It's like good luck finding someone that sophisticated.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1223,"First of all, if you say things long enough, you're going to believe them.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1224,That's a really interesting and fascinating and important point.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1225,"Even if you start out as a lie as a propaganda, I think Hitler is an example of somebody that I think really quickly you start to believe the propaganda.",153
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1226,"Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1227,"It's like, don't you become what you practice?",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1228,"And the answer to that is, well, absolutely, we even know the neurology.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1229,"It's like when you first formulate a concept, huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1230,"But as you practice that, first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1231,And then the the the left participates less and less until you build specialized machinery for exactly that conceptual frame.,125
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1232,"And then you start to see it, not just think it.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1233,"And so if you're telling the same lies over and over, who do you think you're fooling?",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1234,"Think, well, I can withstand my own lies, not if they're effective lies.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1235,"And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people, and then they reflect them back to you, what makes you think you're going to be able to withstand that?",163
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1236,You aren't.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1237,And so I do think Putin believes to the degree that he believes anything.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1238,I do believe that he thinks of himself as a ballwork for christened them against the degeneration of the West.,110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1239,And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin have been talking about the philosopher Alexander Dugan and Putin for 15 years.,126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1240,"Now, what that is is very amorphous.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1241,Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return to the incremental development of Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.,145
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1242,"And to some degree, that's happening in Russia because there's been a return to Orthodox Christianity.",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1243,"Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church has just been co-opted by the state.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1244,"And I would say, there's some evidence for that.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1245,"I've heard, for example, that the metropolitan bones, I don't know if this is true, owns five billion dollars worth of personal property.",137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1246,And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1247,"And it's possible that the Orthodox Church has been co-opted, but there has been somewhat have an Orthodox revival in Russia.",125
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1248,And I don't think that's all bad.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1249,"Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this, if he's just a psychopathic manipulator.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1250,"And, unfortunately, I don't think that's true.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1251,I've read his speeches.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1252,It doesn't look like it to me.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1253,And he is by no means the worst Russian leader of the last 100 years.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1254,"Well, there's quite a selection there.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1255,"There certainly is, but I say that knowing that, even if he doesn't believe it, he's convinced his people that it's true.",121
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1256,"And so we're stuck with the, we're stuck with the claim in either case.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1257,And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1258,Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1259,"And a lot of people reached out to me, experts tell me how I should feel, what I should think about Ukraine.",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1260,"Oh, you naive, Lex, you're so naive.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1261,"You know, here's how it really is.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1262,But then I get to see people that lost their home.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1263,I get to see people on the Russian side who believe there.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1264,I genuinely think that there's some degree to which they have love in their heart.,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1265,They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1266,How else would you motivate young men to go fight?,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1267,"It's just it's these humans destroying not only their homes, but creating generational hate, destroying the possibility of love towards each other.",147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1268,They're basically creating hate.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1269,"What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year, hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1270,"Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not the soldiers in Russia, but hate towards all Russians.",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1271,Hate that will last generations.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1272,"And then you can, you can see I'm just the pain there.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1273,"And then when all these experts talk about agriculture and energy and geopolitics and yeah, maybe like what you say with with the fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on, I just feel like it's missing something deep that war is not fought about any of those things.",271
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1274,War started in wars ofverted based on human beings based on humanity.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1275,Here's another ugly thought since we haven't had enough so far.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1276,We locked everything down for COVID.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1277,How much face-to-face communication was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1278,How about none?,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1279,"How about that was the wrong amount, especially given that Europe was completely dependent on Putin for its energy supplies, well, not completely.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1280,But you know what I mean?,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1281,Materially and significantly.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1282,So maybe had to go talk to him once every six months.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1283,Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble probably.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1284,"And not just in information bubble, how all these experts tell me about human bubble.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1285,"Look, one of the things I've really learned, there's a real emphasis on hospitality in the Old Testament.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1286,I just brought all these scholars together to talk about Exodus.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1287,"I have this security team with me and there are tough military guys, but they're on board for this mission, let's say.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1288,And so they went out of their way to be hospitable to my academic guests.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1289,They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1290,"They spent all day preparing this house I had rented so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars, most of whom I didn't know well, but who said they would come and spend eight days talking about this book with me.",229
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1291,We rented some jet skis.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1292,We had a nice house.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1293,We had fun.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1294,We got to know each other.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1295,And we got to trust each other because we could see that we could have some fun and that we could let our hair down a bit.,122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1296,We didn't have to be on guard.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1297,And that made the talks way deeper.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1298,And then we found out we couldn't get through Exodus in eight days.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1299,And so I had proposed very early on that we're going to double the length.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1300,And so I pulled eight people out of their lives for eight days.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1301,That's not an easy thing to do.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1302,It's also quite expensive.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1303,And the daily wire plus people picked all that up.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1304,"And they said, right, they said, yes, right away.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1305,So we'd love to do this again.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1306,"Well, why?",10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1307,"Well, partly because it was intellectually it was unbelievably engaging.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1308,I learned so much.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1309,It'll take me like a year to digest it if I can ever digest it.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1310,"And but they had, they had a really good time.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1311,"And so when they were offered that combination of intellectual challenge, let's say in hospitality, it was a no brainer.",120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1312,"They just said, every one of them said, if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1313,And this I went to Washington a bunch of times.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1314,And the the culture of hospitality has broken down in Washington 40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1315,They don't have apartments.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1316,Their family isn't there with them.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1317,They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats or Republicans much less across the table.,103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1318,And so and I tried to have some meetings in Washington that were bilateral a couple of times get young Republican congressmen and Democrats together to talk.,157
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1319,"And as soon as they talk, they think, oh, it was so interesting.",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1320,"Because one of the lunches was about 15 people, half Democrats and half Republicans.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1321,And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes talking about why you decided to become a congressman.,112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1322,Just not a job I would take by the way.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1323,He spent 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1324,Your family isn't there with you.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1325,You have to run for reelection every two years.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1326,"You'd be holding to the party apparatus, right?",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1327,You're vilified constantly.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1328,"This is not, you know, people think, well, this is a job for the privilege.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1329,"It's like, yeah, you go and run for congress and find out how much fun it is and put your family on the line and then have to beg for your job every two years.",159
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1330,"Well, your enemies, the worst of your enemies are the and the worst of your friends are viciously henpecking you.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1331,"And so anyways, we have them all sit around the table, say, okay, just say why you ran for congress.",100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1332,"It was so cool, especially for a Canadian because you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1333,It's something to watch.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1334,It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington for every one of them.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1335,"It's like, well, this country's given us so much where families have been so so we've benefited so much from our from our time here.",132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1336,We think this is a wonderful country.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1337,We really felt that we should give back.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1338,And the next one would talk and it was like exactly the same story.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1339,And then it didn't matter if they're a Republican or Democrat.,62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1340,You couldn't tell the difference.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1341,No one could.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1342,And was it genuine?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1343,"It's like, well, are you genuine?",33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1344,You think these people are worse than you?,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1345,"First of all, they're not.",26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1346,"Second of all, they're probably better.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1347,All things considered.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1348,It's not that easy to become a congressman.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1349,"And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch, but by and large, you walk away from your meetings with these people and you think.",134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1350,They're very impressive.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1351,They're really are giving the part of themselves in the name of service.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1352,"Maybe over time, they become cynical and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1353,"But I think a lot of it is healed, I think.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1354,"And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive, but not fully that a lot of it is healed through the power of conversation.",123
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1355,It's just basic social interaction.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1356,"I do think that the effects of this pandemic, especially by listening, listening, just sitting there.",101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1357,And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1358,"It's actually humor and all those kinds of things about personal struggles, all those kinds of things that remind you that you're all just humans.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1359,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1360,"Well, the great leaders that I've met, and I've met some now, they go listen to their constituents.",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1361,It's not a policy discussion.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1362,It's not an ideology discussion.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1363,"They go say, okay, what's your what's your life like?",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1364,And what are your problems?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1365,And tell me about them.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1366,And then they listen.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1367,And then they're struck by them.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1368,And then they gather up all that misery and they bring it to the congressional office or to the parliament.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1369,"And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1370,"And the good leaders, that's a leader leader listens.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1371,So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1372,"And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour, being funny.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1373,That's hard.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1374,"He said, comedy is the most stand-up comedy, which is what I do in some real sense.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1375,It's a thing I do that it's the most akin to what I'm doing on my book tours.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1376,I would say it's the closest analog.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1377,"He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1378,"And I thought, well, why what do you mean?",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1379,"Because see, it's just the monologue.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1380,And it's a prepared monologue.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1381,"I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience while you're telling your jokes.",91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1382,And you got to get the timing right.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1383,But you have a body of jokes.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1384,"He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1385,And I've been told this by other comedians.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1386,You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1387,And you got some new material and you think it's funny.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1388,And you go into a club and you lay out your new material and people laugh at some of it.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1389,And you pay attention to what they laugh at and what they don't laugh at.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1390,So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1391,And you get rid of everything that isn't funny.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1392,"And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny, the crowd will tell you what's funny.",95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1393,"So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows in each is an hour long and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.",120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1394,"So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours more than 98% of it.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1395,Collect two minutes per show.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1396,So you're not very funny at all.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1397,"You're like, funny, two percent of the time.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1398,"You aggregate that, man, you're a screen.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1399,"So that's what a leader does is that is what a leader does is goes out and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.",125
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1400,"And then I do think that's revivify to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded because then the person can say to themselves despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies, I'm gathering up the misery and the hope.",235
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1401,And I'm bringing it forward where it can be.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1402,Giving it a voice.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1403,"Yeah, giving it.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1404,That's right.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1405,Giving it a voice.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1406,Can you actually take me through a day because this is fascinating through your comedy tour.,92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1407,What is a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1408,Which is this very interesting day.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1409,Let's look at the day when you have to speak.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1410,"Preparing your mind, thinking of what you're going to talk about, preparing yourself physically, mentally, to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking, how do you adjust what you're thinking through and how do you come down from that?",245
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1411,So you can start all again as a limited biological system.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1412,"Well, I'm usually up by seven and ready to go by seven, thirty or eight coffee.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1413,"No, staking water.",18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1414,How many times a day stake?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1415,All that's all I eat.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1416,How many times?,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1417,Three or four depending on the day.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1418,Staking water.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1419,Staking sparkling water.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1420,"Yeah, so monastic as said, this is a man.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1421,Why did the proper?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1422,I usually just once a day.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1423,I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night and just ate two steaks.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1424,And how was that?,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1425,It was wonderful.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1426,"Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing, you know, could be worse.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1427,"So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight because we're generally moving.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1428,What does it moving me in your cost?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1429,Flying somewhere.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1430,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1431,And we usually use private flights now because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough and you cannot not make a venue.,126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1432,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1433,So that's rule number one on the tour.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1434,You make the show.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1435,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1436,So everything and then number rule number two is anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone because there is zero room for error.,137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1437,"Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary unaddressed error.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1438,So there's going to be errors.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1439,"The guys I have around me now, if they make a mistake, they fix it right away.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1440,So and that's great.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1441,There's a lot of people relying on you to be there.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1442,So you have like 4000 people typically.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1443,"So, so then I'm on the plane and I'm usually I usually write or often because there's no internet on the plane and that's a good use of time.",141
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1444,So I'm writing a new book.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1445,So I write on the plane typing or handwriting typing.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1446,"Yeah, typing.",13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1447,And then we land and we go to it's usually early afternoon by then we go to a hotel.,84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1448,It's usually a nice hotel.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1449,It's not corporate.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1450,I don't really like corporate hotels.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1451,My secretary and my one of my logistics guys has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels.,102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1452,"Boutique hotels are usually in the old parts of the city, especially in Europe.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1453,Some were interesting.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1454,And so we go there and then lunch usually and sometimes that's an air fryer and a stake in the hotel room and I leave a trail of air fryer's behind me all across the world.,172
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1455,And then Tammy and I usually go out and have a walk or something and take a look at the city.,93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1456,And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half or an hour half an hour.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1457,Like a nap.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1458,"Oh, just now I have to sleep for 20 minutes.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1459,And that's about all I can sleep.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1460,But I need to do that in the late hour.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1461,Never refresh as your mind.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1462,Yep.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1463,That gives me that wakes me up again for the evening.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1464,And then Tammy has to sleep longer.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1465,She's still recovering from her illness.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1466,And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1467,And that's absolutely necessary for both of us or things start to get frayed.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1468,And so then we go to the venue.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1469,And then I usually sit for an hour.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1470,"If I'm going to lecture, I've been doing a lot of Q&As and that's a little easier.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1471,"But if I'm going to lecture, I have to sit for an hour and then I think, okay, what question am I trying to investigate?",120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1472,I have to have that.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1473,That's the point.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1474,What mystery am I trying to unravel?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1475,"It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book, because technically it's a book tour.",95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1476,But each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1477,And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery in some sense.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1478,And there's no end to the amount it can be explored.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1479,And so I have the question.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1480,My question might be something like put your put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.,108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1481,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1482,What does that mean exactly?,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1483,Put what does house mean?,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1484,What does put what does put mean that active verb?,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1485,What does perfect and order mean?,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1486,Why before you criticize the world?,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1487,What does it mean to criticize?,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1488,What does it mean to criticize the world?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1489,How can you do that properly or improperly?,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1490,So I start to think about how to decompose the question.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1491,And you start to think which of these decomposition are important to really dig into?,85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1492,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1493,"Well, then they'll strike me.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1494,"It's like, okay, there's something there that that I've been maybe noodling around on that I would like to investigate further.",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1495,"Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1496,"I think, well, I have this story that I know I have this story and I have this story, but I haven't juxtaposed them before.",123
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1497,And there's going to be some interesting interaction in the juxtaposition.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1498,So I have the question and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1499,And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1500,"And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that and see what happens.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1501,And so then what I want to do is concentrate on that process well attending to the audience to make sure that the words are landing.,132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1502,And then see if I can delve into it deeply enough so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1503,"Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1504,"Maybe I'm wrong, but my experience has been if I fall into the conversation and we know about the time frame, there'll be a natural narrative arc.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1505,And then so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is and you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.,110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1506,"And then if you really pay attention, you can see that's a good place to stop.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1507,And it's kind of you come to a point and you have to be alert and patient to see that.,86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1508,And you have to be willing to be satisfied with where you've got to.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1509,"But if you do that, and then it's like a comedian making the punchline work, it's like I've got all these balls in the air and they're going somewhere and this is how they come together and people love that, right?",214
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1510,"You say, oh, this and this and this and this, whack together.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1511,And that's an insight.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1512,And it is very much like a punch line.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1513,"Well, that's interesting because your mind actually some fan of your podcast too.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1514,And you are always driving towards that.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1515,"I would say for me in a podcast conversation, there's often a kind of Alice and Wonderland type of exploration down the rabbit hole, man.",137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1516,"And then you just, and you think pops up the more absurd, the wilder, the better conversations with Elon are like this.",119
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1517,"It's like actually the more you drive towards an arc, the more on comfort you start to get in a fun absurd conversation because, oh, I'm now one of the normies.",160
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1518,"No, I don't want that.",22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1519,"I want to be, I want to wrap it.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1520,I want to crazy because it makes some more fun.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1521,"But somehow throughout it, there is wisdom that he tried to grasp at such that there is a thread to.",100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1522,"Well, that's the thing, man.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1523,"You're following the thread, yeah, the thread.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1524,"Well, that's right.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1525,That's what we're trying to do.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1526,"That thread, that thread is the proper balance between structure and spontaneity.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1527,And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1528,And that's the logos in the dialogue.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1529,And it really is the logos.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1530,And God only knows what that means.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1531,"You know, I mean, the biblical claim is that logos is the fundamental principle of reality.",91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1532,And I think that's true.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1533,I actually think that's true.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1534,"Because I think that that meaning that guides you, well, here's a way of thinking about it, been writing about this recently.",125
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1535,What's real matter?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1536,"It's like, okay, that's one answer.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1537,What's real?,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1538,What matters is real?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1539,That's how you act.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1540,"Okay, so that's different than matter.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1541,"It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1542,How about pain?,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1543,Why is it the most real?,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1544,Try arguing it away.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1545,Good luck.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1546,So pain is the fundamental reality.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1547,All right.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1548,"Well, that's rough.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1549,Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1550,"Yeah, doesn't it lead to a philosophy that's antithetical towards being the most fundamental reality is pain?",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1551,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1552,Is there anything more fundamental than pain?,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1553,Love?,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1554,Really?,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1555,"If you're in pain, love and truth, that's what you got.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1556,"And you know, if they're more powerful than pain, maybe they're the most real things.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1557,"When you think about reality, what is real?",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1558,That is the most real thing.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1559,"Well, it's a tough one, right?",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1560,"Because you have to, because if you're a scientist, a materialist, think, well, the matter is the most real.",108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1561,"It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1562,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1563,"And so, and then when push comes to shove and it will, you'll find out what's most real.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1564,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1565,"I feel like this is missing, physical reality is missing some of the things.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1566,"So, of course, pain has a biological component and all those kinds of things, but it's missing something deep about the human condition that at least the modern science is not able to describe, but it is reaching towards that.",226
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1567,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1568,And it's the reason one way to describe it as you're describing is the reason is reaching it is because underneath of science is this assumption that there's a deep logos thing to this whole thing we're trying to do.,216
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1569,"Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1570,"In some sense, there's two logos traditions.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1571,"There's the the Greek, rational, enlightenment tradition.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1572,That's a logos tradition.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1573,And it insists that there's a logos in nature and that science is the way to approach it.,89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1574,"And then there's the Judeo-Christian logos, which is more embodied and more spiritual.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1575,And I would say the West is actually an attempt to unite those two.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1576,And it's the proper attempt to unite those two because they need to be united.,78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1577,"And I see the union coming in your terms, you know, I talk to friends to wall, for example, about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.",148
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1578,And that's pretty close biologically.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1579,Is it power?,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1580,"Because that's the claim, even from the biologist's often, that most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1581,"It's like, oh yeah, dominant, hey, you mean using compulsion?",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1582,"Okay, let's look.",17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1583,Are the chimp's who use compulsion the most successful?,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1584,And the answer is sporadically and rarely.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1585,"And for short, well, that's sporadically for short periods of time.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1586,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1587,Because they meet an unpleasant end.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1588,"The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control, wait for a week moment and then tear them into shreds, right?",121
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1589,Every dictator's terror.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1590,"And for good reason, and DeWal has showed that the alpha chimps, the males, who do have preferential mating access often, are often and reliably the best peacemakers and the most reciprocal.",190
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1591,"And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1592,And that's a way better principle than power.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1593,"And it's something like I've been thinking, what's the antithesis of the spirit of power?",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1594,I think it's the spirit of play.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1595,"And you know, you, I don't know what you think about that, but when you have a good podcast conversation, you already described it in some sense as play.",153
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1596,"It's like there's a structure, right?",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1597,Because it's an ordered conversation.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1598,But you want there to be play in the system.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1599,"And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1600,And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1601,I'm not trying to impose that even on that's another thing I don't do.,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1602,"I didn't come to this conversation at all, thinking, here's what I want out of a conversation with Lex Friedman.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1603,"Like instrumentally, I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1604,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1605,I like his podcasts.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1606,He's doing something right.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1607,I don't know what it is.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1608,He asks interesting questions.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1609,I'll go have a conversation with him.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1610,Where's it going to go?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1611,Wherever it goes.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1612,Embracing the spirit of play.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1613,"So what you have this, when you're lecturing, you're going in front of the crowd.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1614,"Yeah, you're thought of a question.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1615,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1616,You get on the stage.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1617,"First of all, are you nervous at all?",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1618,"I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down, thinking through the structure initially, which is why my wife and I have been doing Q&As.",130
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1619,And that's easier on me.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1620,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1621,"It's the, it's the way comedians and nervous like Joe Rogan just did his special.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1622,So this weekend.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1623,"And so he now has to sit nervously like a comedian does, which is like, I have no material now.",95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1624,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1625,I have to start from scratch.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1626,"Well, that's when I was doing the lectures constantly instead of the Q&As.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1627,"Basically, what I was doing was writing a whole book chapter every night.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1628,"And you know, now that's a bit of an exaggeration because I would return to themes that I had developed.",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1629,But it's not really an exaggeration because I didn't ever just go over wrote material ever.,91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1630,"So it was, it's very demanding.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1631,And that parts nerve rocking because I sit down.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1632,It's an hour before the show.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1633,"And I think, can I do this?",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1634,"And you know, the answer is what you did it a thousand times.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1635,But that's not this time.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1636,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1637,"It's like, can I come up with a question?",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1638,Can I think through the structure?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1639,Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1640,Can I pull it together?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1641,And the answer is I don't know.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1642,"And so then I get it together in my mind, I think, and that's hard.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1643,It takes effort in it's nerve-racking.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1644,"Okay, I got it.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1645,"But then there's the moment you go out on stage and you think, well, I know I had it, but can I do it?",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1646,No notes.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1647,"And then the question is, well, you're going to find out.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1648,"Well, you do it.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1649,And so then I go out on stage and I don't talk to the audience.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1650,I talk to one person at a time.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1651,"And you can talk to one person, you know, because you know how to do that.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1652,"So I talk to a person and not too long, because I don't want to make them too nervous.",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1653,And then someone else and someone else.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1654,And then I contact with the audience.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1655,"And then I can tell if the words are landing and I listen is like, are they wrestling around?",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1656,Are they dead quiet?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1657,Because you want dead quiet.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1658,You're so I see that's what focus sounds like they're you're in it together then.,81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1659,You bet.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1660,"Well, and I also here's a good rule if you're learning to speak publicly.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1661,I never say a word till everyone is 100% quiet.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1662,"And that's it's a great way to start a talk because you're setting the frame, and if the frame is well, I'll talk while you're talking, the message is well, you can talk.",170
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1663,This is a place where everybody can talk.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1664,"It's like, no, it's not.",24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1665,This is a place where people pay to hear me talk.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1666,So I'm not going to talk till everyone's listening.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1667,And so then you get that stillness.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1668,And then you just wait because that stillness turns into an expectation.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1669,And then it comes turns into a kind of nervous expectations like what the hell is he doing?,91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1670,It's not manipulative.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1671,It's a sense of timing.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1672,"It's like just when that's right, you think, okay, now it's time to start.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1673,"Well, the interesting thing about that nervous expectation is from an audience perspective wearing it together.",111
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1674,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1675,"I mean, there is into that silence, there's a togetherness to it.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1676,"Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1677,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1678,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1679,And that's a great thing.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1680,"I mean, you love that at a concert when everyone, it's not silence then, but when everyone's attention is unified and everyone's moving in unison, it's like we're all worshiping the same thing.",193
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1681,Right?,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1682,"And that would be the point of the conversation, the point of the lecture.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1683,And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1684,"And it's union, it's communion because everyone's doing it at the same time.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1685,"And so I mean, there's not much difference between lecture, theater and a church in that regard, right?",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1686,It's the same fundamental layout and structure.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1687,"And they're very intagrally associated with one another, one really grew out of the other, the lecture theater grow out of the church.",134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1688,So it's perfectly reasonable to be thinking about it in those terms.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1689,"And so, and then okay, so after the lecture, we play a piece of music that is a piece of music that I've been producing with some musicians for a couple of books.",162
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1690,I'm going to release in the fall.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1691,"Terrible books, ABC of Childhood Tragedy, they're called dark, dark books, dark and comical books, terrible books, heartbreaking illustrations.",143
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1692,We've set them to music and so we play a piece from that.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1693,"And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people to have photographs.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1694,"And so each of those is a little, is there a little sparkle of human connection?",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1695,"A lot, a lot.",13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1696,"It's very intense, 10 seconds with every person you think, well, how can 10 seconds be intense?",95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1697,"It's like, pay enough attention.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1698,It gets intense real quick.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1699,This is a break your heart to say goodbye so many times.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1700,"It's like being in a wedding lineup, you know, at a wedding with that you want to be out.",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1701,And everybody's dressed up.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1702,"And that's so weird, because I bought these expensive suits when I went on tour.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1703,And I broke my heart because I spent so much money on them.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1704,"I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1705,"I thought, no way, man.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1706,I mean this 100%.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1707,And so I'm going to dress with respect.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1708,And like 60% of the audience comes in two or three piece suits.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1709,They're all dressed up.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1710,Then there's this line to greet me and they're all happy to see me.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1711,That's not so hard to take.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1712,"You know, although it is in a sense, right?",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1713,Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1714,"And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1715,"It's like, yes, you do most of the time.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1716,"Yeah, it's intense.",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1717,Very intense.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1718,And I don't know if you've had a taste of this no doubt because people recognize.,81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1719,"I also have when a person recognizes me and they come with the love and they're often brilliant people, one of the thoughts I have to deal with, one of the dragons in my own mind is you know, thinking that I don't deserve that kind of attention.",245
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1720,"And so, well, you probably don't.",33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1721,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1722,I don't.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1723,So it's a burden in that I have to step up to be the kind of person that deserves that not deserves that but in part deserves that kind of attention.,149
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1724,And that's like holy shit.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1725,"It's crucially important too because if someone comes up to you in an airport and they know who you are and they're brave enough to admire you or who you are attempting to be and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.",225
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1726,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1727,So it's a high stakes enterprise.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1728,"And the flip side of that, especially with young people, a few words you can say can change the direction of their life one way or another.",139
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1729,And so I really have to watch this too in airports.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1730,I do not like airports.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1731,I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1732,They've always bothered me.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1733,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1734,They really bother me.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1735,And I'm an unpleasant travel companion for my wife sometimes because of that.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1736,Although I think we've worked that out.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1737,Thank God.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1738,Because a lot of traveling.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1739,"But most of the security guards and and the border personnel, all those people, they know me.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1740,"And as a general rule, they're positively predisposed to me.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1741,And so if I'm pivish or irritable.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1742,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1743,"Then well, that's not good.",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1744,It's not good.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1745,And so that's a tight route to walk to because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.,91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1746,"But by the same token, you know, if you're just one of the crowd just you know, sometimes you it's good just to be one of the crowd.",132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1747,And then you're a little irritable.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1748,And people can just brush that off.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1749,"But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to, because that's what admiration is.",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1750,"And then you're be and you betray that, then that's a real they'll never forget it.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1751,And then they'll tell everyone too.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1752,So it takes a lot of alertness.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1753,"And so Tammy and I our life has got complicated because in Toronto, for example, we can't really just go for a walk.",116
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1754,It's always a high-dram up production because always people come up and they have some heart-rending story to tell.,115
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1755,And I'm not being cynical about that.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1756,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1757,It's a hard thing to bear because people don't do that.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1758,They don't just open themselves up to you like that and share the tragedy of their life.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1759,But that's an everyday occurrence.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1760,"And so when we go up to our cottage, which is out of the city, it's a relief, you know, because as wonderful as that is, like it's a weird I have a weird life because everywhere I go, it's very weird.",200
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1761,It's like I'm surrounded by old friends because I walk down the street in any city now virtually.,97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1762,And people say hello doctor Peterson.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1763,So nice to see you or they say better things than that.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1764,Very rarely bad things.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1765,"One experience in 5,000 maybe very rare, although you don't forget those either.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1766,But it's very it's very strange.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1767,So.,3
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1768,And there's an intimacy they know you well.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1769,And because they leap into they avoid the small talk off.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1770,They leap into familiarity.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1771,It really is like it's an old friend.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1772,"And it feels like that for me personally, the experience is the goodbye hurts because you know, there's a sense where you're never going to see that friend again.",162
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1773,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1774,"Yeah, that's a strange thing.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1775,"So to me, a lot of the a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1776,And it is.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1777,You're right about that.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1778,"And I mean, that's I suppose in some sense, part of the pain of opening yourself up to people because they also Tammy has been struck particularly.",147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1779,"She said, I really never knew what men were like.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1780,"I said, well, what do you mean?",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1781,"She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are when they come and talk to you because it's always the same.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1782,The pattern is very similar.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1783,The person comes up.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1784,"They're mostly men, not always, but mostly.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1785,"And they're tentative and they're very polite, very, very polite.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1786,"And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1787,"Do you mind, you know, do you mind it?",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1788,I say that they're not bothering me.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1789,And I'm doing everything I can to not be the guy who's bothered by that.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1790,"It's like, who do you think you are?",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1791,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1792,You're the guy that what is famous and now is above that?,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1793,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1794,You don't want to be that guy.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1795,So you want to be grateful all the time when people open up like that.,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1796,"And and so you've got to be alert and on point to do that properly, like right away because for these for you, it's five seconds or 10 seconds or 20 seconds, whatever it is.",173
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1797,"But for them, they've opened up.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1798,And so you can really nail them if you're foolish.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1799,"After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1800,How do how do you find yourself again?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1801,"Well, that was often when I got caught in Twitter traps.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1802,"You know, because I'm so burnt out by then from the from the talk and the audience interactions and the whole day, because it's a new city.",139
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1803,It's a new hotel.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1804,"It's it's a new 5,000 people.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1805,It's a new book chapter.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1806,It's a whole new horizon of ideas.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1807,And it's off to another city the next day.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1808,I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good at controlling my impulses as I might be.,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1809,And Twitter was a real catastrophe for that because it would hook me.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1810,"And then I couldn't, like I used to when I was working on my book a lot.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1811,"I used to call Tammy and say, look, you have to come and get me.",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1812,I can't stop.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1813,I can't stop.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1814,I got tired of you.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1815,And then I kind of because it's part of a kind of hypomanic focus.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1816,I couldn't quit.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1817,"It's like, oh, no, I'm still writing.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1818,I need to get away from this.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1819,But I couldn't stop.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1820,"And so it's better to to read something book fiction, nonfiction fiction.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1821,Stephen King.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1822,I was reading a lot of Stephen King when I was on tour last time.,65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1823,That was good.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1824,I like Stephen King a lot.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1825,So great narratives.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1826,Great and great characterization.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1827,"You know, so and there's a familiarity about Stephen King's writing too that he writes about people you know.",109
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1828,And so I really found that a relief.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1829,And so that was useful.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1830,"And that in order to tolerate this, let's say, or to be able to sustain it.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1831,"Well, let's take a lot of negotiation on the part of Tammy and I because she's dragged into this.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1832,"And you know, her life is part of this, whatever this is.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1833,"And she's had to find her way and has, for example, now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1834,And she she found that she didn't want to be on the tour this spring.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1835,And I was ill again for part of it and not made it complicated.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1836,"But she went away back home and she came back and she said, she was nervous, but she said, I think I need my own room.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1837,And part of me was not happy with that.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1838,"Like, what do you mean you need your like, are we not married anymore?",70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1839,It's like you need your own room.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1840,"And she said, well, you know, I can't she has to do exercises because she was really sick.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1841,And she has to keep herself in shape.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1842,And and she has to have some time to do that.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1843,She does a lot of prayer and meditation and she needs the time.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1844,"And she has her own podcast, which is going quite well.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1845,And she needs the time.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1846,And and I trust her.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1847,"And she said, well, I need this in order to continue.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1848,"And I thought, well, okay, if you need this in order to continue.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1849,"Yes, because she went away and didn't say, well, I don't want to be on the tour.",80
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1850,I don't want to do this anymore.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1851,"She went away and prayed, let's say, how can I continue to do this?",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1852,And that was the answer.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1853,And so she has her own hotel room.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1854,And that was a really good decision on her part.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1855,And she's very good.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1856,And getting better all the time at figuring out what has to happen for her to make this sustainable.,100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1857,And all that's been is a plus.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1858,Because I don't want to travel without her.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1859,And and I don't want her life to be miserable.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1860,And I want her to be fully on board.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1861,And so she has to be properly selfish.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1862,Like everyone does in a relationship.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1863,"Hey, and you have to not just say, this is a weird thing that you're doing.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1864,And you have to both you and her have to figure out how to like how to manage this very intense intellectual social journey.,124
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1865,"Well, there's another element to it too that I didn't tell you about.",69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1866,So that was a typical day.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1867,"But it's missing a big component because usually we also have a dinner with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose, 10 to 30 from each country.",148
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1868,Because I have a network of people who have networks who are setting me up with key decision makers in each country.,116
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1869,And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1870,Now sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1871,But sometimes the talks are back to back.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1872,And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1873,And and then people are showing us exciting things and tours in the cities.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1874,And which is all like it's a surfeit of wonderful.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1875,"Yes, exactly.",13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1876,"But you're still, yeah, you have to be there for it.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1877,You have to be present for it mentally.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1878,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1879,"As a curious mind as an intellectual mind, how do you how do you get the sleep?",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1880,"Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1881,"Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years, I thought about that a lot too.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1882,"You know, that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that while I was ill because it appeared in some sense that the reason I was ill was because I was taking benzodiazepines.",181
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1883,But that isn't why I was ill. And then I took them and very low dose.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1884,And I took that for a long time.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1885,And it helped whatever was wrong with me.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1886,And it looks like it was an allergy or maybe multiple allergies.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1887,And then that stopped working.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1888,And so I took a little bit more for about a month.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1889,And that made it way worse.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1890,And so then I cut back a lot.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1891,And then then things really got out of hand.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1892,And so there was a deeper thing.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1893,"Oh, yeah.",9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1894,Definitely.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1895,"Oh, yeah.",9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1896,What can you put words to?,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1897,"Well, I had a lot of the mute.",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1898,"While my daughter, as everyone knows, has a very reactive immune system.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1899,Tammy has three immunological conditions.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1900,Each of them quite serious.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1901,"And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis, which is an autoimmune condition and a little p-sharyata and chronic um disease, all of which appeared to be allergic related.",170
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1902,And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1903,And so that and that I think was at the bottom of because I also had this proclivity to depression that was part of my family history.,134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1904,But I think that was all immunological as far as I can tell.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1905,"So one of the things that's happened to me, I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1906,Like I could breathe about one fifth as much as I sometimes could.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1907,And so I was always short of breath.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1908,"And it looks like what that was perhaps was I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction, which is not pleasant.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1909,"And that's hypersympathetic activation, no parasympathetic activation.",70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1910,I couldn't relax at all.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1911,That's an immunological response.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1912,"Eligic response, yeah.",22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1913,"So anyways, that was what seemed now.",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1914,I don't like to talk about this much because it's so bloody radical.,68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1915,"And you know, I don't like to propagate it, but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1916,"I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches of going to my gum disease, which is incurable.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1917,And I had multiple surgeries to deal with it.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1918,It's completely gone.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1919,It took three years.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1920,"My right eye, which was quite cloudy, is cleared up completely.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1921,What else has changed?,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1922,"Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly.",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1923,I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator of nutritional science.,78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1924,I have my skepticism towards the degree to which it is currently science because like a lot of complex systems is very full of mystery and full of profiteers that people that profit of different kinds of diets.,210
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1925,"But I should say for me personally, it does seem that I feel by far the best when I eat only meat.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1926,It's very interesting.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1927,"And I discovered that a long time ago, first of all, how do you discover it?",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1928,"So by the discovery went like this, I started listening to ultra marathon runners about 15 years ago.",101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1929,And they started talking about fat adapted running.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1930,So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast to enjoy running.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1931,"In fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1932,"So that was like step one is like, oh, okay, if I maintain something called the math rule, which is a pretty low heart rate.",124
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1933,"If I maintain that, you can actually get pretty fast while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1934,"Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1935,So I got into that on top of that.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1936,"I also, they also fast often.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1937,So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1938,People call it intermittent fasting.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1939,"But that's an optimization of death because when you fast your body logically, and obviously if you think about it biologically, well, what is your body scavenged first?",169
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1940,"Well, damaged tissue.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1941,"So the, and I know the literature on fasting to some degree, and it's very compelling literature.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1942,"If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too, below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1943,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1944,That's a lot.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1945,30% like it's like 30%.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1946,"Yeah, yeah, 30%.",16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1947,"Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things that make me nervous because I always feel like there's no free lunch that I'm going to pay for it somehow.",154
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1948,"But there is a focus that I am able to attain when I fast, especially when I eat once a day.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1949,My mind is almost like nervously focused.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1950,"It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1951,"I wonder how much of that's associated with, well, imagine that that signifies lack of food, which is not that hard to imagine.",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1952,"Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert in that situation, right?",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1953,"Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode, let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.",111
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1954,And God only knows maybe human being should be in hunting mode all the time.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1955,"Often, but that we don't know that.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1956,So I wonder if it has a stress on the system that long-term causes the system to get it doesn't it doesn't look like it.,120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1957,It seems on the case of fasting not.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1958,"And then on top of that, I discovered that the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.",100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1959,So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diets.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1960,"So I just discovered through that process, if someone's adding me, but just me, I just feel a lot of the things that make me feel weird about food like a little groggy or like full or just whatever.",198
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1961,"The aspects of food that I don't enjoy, they're not there with meat.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1962,And I'm still able to enjoy company.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1963,"And when I once a day and eat meat, at least in Texas, you could still have all the mariment of, you have dinner with friends.",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1964,"Now, I don't do the, you know, you have a very serious thing that there's health benefits that you are very serious about.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1965,"For me, I can still drink whiskey.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1966,"I still do the things that add a little bit of spice, spice into the thing.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1967,"Now, when you complete remove the spice, it does become more difficult.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1968,"Yeah, it's more difficult socially.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1969,"And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb, although she might be able to eat non-aged beef.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1970,"And that makes traveling complicated too, right?",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1971,"Because, well, for obvious reasons, it's like, really, that's all you can eat.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1972,"Yeah, well, salivie.",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1973,And maybe that's a form of craziness.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1974,"But if you're going to return to actually the thing you were talking about, when you're thinking about a question before the lecture, yeah, let me ask you about thinking in general.",181
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1975,This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller think a lot about is thinking how to think.,91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1976,How do you think through an idea?,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1977,"Well, first of all, I think, okay, that's a really good question.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1978,"We tried to work that out with this essay app that my son and I have developed because if you're going to write the first question is, well, what should I write about?",167
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1979,What's the name of the app?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1980,essay.app.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1981,"And well, the first question is, well, what bugs you?",53

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1983,This is such a cool thing.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1984,"It's like, where's my destiny?",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1985,"Well, what bothers you?",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1986,"Well, that's where your destiny is.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1987,Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1988,Why did those things bother you?,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1989,There's a lot of things you could be bothered by.,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1990,"I come million things, man, but some things grip you.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1991,They bug you and they might make you resentful and bitter because they bug you so much.,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1992,"Like, they're your things, man.",31

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1994,So then I look for a question that I would like the answer to that I don't and I would really like the answer to it.,116
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1995,So I don't assume I already have the answer because I would actually really like to have the answer.,100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1996,"So if I could get a better answer, great.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",1997,And so that's the first thing and that's like a prayer.,55

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2001,"It's like, here's a mystery, which means I don't know.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2002,"I would like to delve into it further, which means I don't know enough already.",79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2003,And then then comes the revelation.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2004,"It's like, well, what's a revelation?",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2005,"Well, if you ask yourself a question, it's a real question.",59

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2008,"So from somewhere, that's right.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2009,From somewhere.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2010,Where do they come from?,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2011,Do you have a sense?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2012,Depends on what you're aiming at.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2013,Depends on the question.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2014,"No, no, it does to some degree.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2015,Depends on your intent.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2016,So imagine that your intent is to make things better.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2017,Then maybe they come from the place that's designed to make things better.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2018,Maybe your intent is to make things worse.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2019,Then they come from hell.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2020,"And you think, no, it really is like, you're so sure about that.",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2021,Are you?,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2022,Is your intent conscious?,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2023,Like are you able to expect what it is?,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2024,"Conscious and habitual, right?",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2025,"Because as you practice something consciously, it becomes habitual.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2026,But it's conscious.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2027,"It's like I, when I sit down before I do a lecture, I think, okay, what's the goal here to do the best job I can to what end?",125
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2028,"Well, people are coming here, not for political issues.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2029,They're coming here because they're trying to make their lives better.,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2030,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2031,So what are we doing?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2032,"We're conducting a joint investigation into the nature of that, which makes life better.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2033,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2034,What's my role to do as good a job about that as possible?,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2035,What state of mind do I have to be at?,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2036,Am I annoyed about the theater?,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2037,"Or am I, do I my clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people have showed up at substantial expense and trouble to come and listen to me talk?",137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2038,"And if I'm not in that state of mind, I think, well, maybe I need something to eat or maybe I need to talk to someone because that in gratitude is no place to start.",165
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2039,"It's like I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2040,"And so that, that orientation has to be there.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2041,"And then I, it's a conscious, all this is conscious.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2042,What are my serving?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2043,The highest good I can conceptualize.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2044,What is that?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2045,"I have some sense, but I don't know it in the final analysis, which is why the investigation is being conducted.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2046,Who's doing it?,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2047,"Me, whoever I'm communing with and the audience.",48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2048,"And so I want, I try to get myself and I chase everybody away for that.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2049,It's like I have to do that by myself.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2050,Are you writing stuff down?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2051,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2052,"At that point, I make, I just make point notes.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2053,And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2054,"But then I, on stage, I never refer to them.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2055,And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2056,Kind of an interesting thing.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2057,From where do powerful phrases come from?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2058,"Do you have a, do you try to encapsulate an idea into a sentence or two?",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2059,"Well, I, when I talk, and I practice this since consciously, since 1985, I try to feel and see if the words are stepping stones or foundation stones, right?",156
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2060,"Is like, is this solid?",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2061,Is this word solid?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2062,Is this phrase solid?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2063,Is this sentence solid?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2064,"Like, it's a real sense of fundamental foundation under each word.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2065,And I suppose people ask me if I pray.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2066,"And I would say, I pray before every word.",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2067,"Well, when you're, when you're asking questions, like, you're very clear, headed, and present in your ability to ask questions and inquire.",139
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2068,So how do you do that?,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2069,"So first of all, I'm worried that my mind easily gets trapped when I step on a word.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2070,And I know it's unstable.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2071,You kind of realize that you don't really know the definitions of many words you use.,85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2072,And that can be debilitating.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2073,So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2074,Because otherwise you get trapped.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2075,You don't want to be obsessional.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2076,"Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2077,"Right, right, right.",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2078,"Well, you know, and then everything else just explodes.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2079,You're a big picture idea explodes and you lost yourself in the minutia.,72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2080,"Well, neurologically, there's a production center and a netting center.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2081,And those can be separately affected by strokes.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2082,"And so often when people are writing or talking, they try to activate both at the same time.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2083,"And that's so people will try to write an essay and get every sentence, right?",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2084,"In the first draft, that's a big mistake.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2085,"And so then you might say, well, how can you be careful with your words, but carefree?",86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2086,"And the answer is, orient yourself properly, right?",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2087,"Well, in the conversation we're having, you have an orientation structure.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2088,You want to be prepared.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2089,You want to be attentive.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2090,Then you want to have an interesting conversation.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2091,And you want to have the kind of interesting conversation that other people want to listen to that will be good for them in some manner.,136
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2092,"Okay, so that's pretty good frame.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2093,"And then you kind of scour your heart and you think, is that really what you want?",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2094,Are you after fame or after notoriety or are you after money?,61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2095,"I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad, but they're not optimal, especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?",135
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2096,And so they can contaminate you.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2097,So you want to be decontaminated.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2098,"So you have the right trip, let's say.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2099,"And so you have to put yourself, that's a meditative practice.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2100,You have to put yourself in the right receptive position with the right goal in mind.,85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2101,"Then you can, and I think you can get better and better at this, then you can trust what's going to happen.",107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2102,"You know, so for example, before I came here, I mean, I presume you have a reason for doing the podcast with me.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2103,What's the reason?,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2104,"I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2105,So the reason is evolved.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2106,The one of the reasons is I've listened to you for quite a long time.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2107,So you've become one way friend.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2108,And I have many one way friends.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2109,Some of my best friends don't even know I exist.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2110,So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audiobooks.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2111,"Actually, most of my friends are dead.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2112,"Yeah, right.",12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2113,The writers of a definition of a reader.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2114,"I got a lot of dead, great dead friends.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2115,"So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose, and have a conversation.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2116,"And then there's this kind of puzzle that I've been longing to solve the same reason I went to Ukraine of asking this question of myself, who am I?",147
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2117,And what was this part of the world?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2118,What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2119,"That I lost so much my family there, and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2120,Now that place includes the Soviet Union.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2121,It includes Russia and Ukraine.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2122,It includes Nazi Germany.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2123,"It includes these big, powerful leaders and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty, the power of the dream.",121
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2124,But we're also the torture that was forced onto them through different governmental institutions.,97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2125,And you are somebody that seemed from some angle to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2126,"And not in some sort of historical sense, but in a deeply psychological human sense.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2127,What is that?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2128,We'll repeat again in what ways are repeating again.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2129,And how can we stop it?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2130,And how can we stop it?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2131,And so that's the crucial issue.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2132,"I felt I wanted to, from a very different background, pull it to the threat of that curiosity.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2133,"In an engineer, your psychologist both lost in that curiosity and both were suited.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2134,And a talk with various levels of eloquence about sort of the shadows of these that that history cast on us.,108
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2135,And so that was one.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2136,"And also the psychology, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2137,I was fascinated by the human mind.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2138,"Until I discovered artificial intelligence, the fact that I could program and make a robot move.",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2139,"And until I discovered that magic, I thought I wanted to understand the human mind, but being psychiatrically by talking to people, by to talk therapy, psychotherapy.",166
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2140,Now you got the best of both worlds because you get to talk to people and you get to build robots.,98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2141,"Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot that I felt like by building the thing, you start to try to understand it.",126
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2142,That's one way.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2143,"I mean, we're all, we all have different skills and proclivity.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2144,So like my particular one is has to do with I learned by building.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2145,I think through a thing by building it.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2146,And programming is a wonderful thing because it allows you to like build a little toy example.,94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2147,"So in the same way, you can do a little thought experiment.",59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2148,Programming allows you to create a thought experiment in action.,64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2149,It can move.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2150,It can live.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2151,It can right.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2152,And then you could ask questions of it.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2153,"So all of those because of my interest in Freud and young, you're also in different ways have have dealt deeply into humanity, the human psyche through the perspective of those of those psychologists.",200
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2154,"So for all those reasons, I thought our password was yeah.",58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2155,"So that well, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2156,You had all sorts of reasons.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2157,"And then you think, well, are you just letting the conversation go where it will?",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2158,"It's like, well, not exactly.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2159,You spent all this time.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2160,"It's not like this came about by accident, this conversation.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2161,You spent all this time framing it.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2162,And so all of that provides the implicit substructure for the play in the conversation.,87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2163,"And if you have that implicit, here's another way.",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2164,"This is very much worth knowing is if you get the implicit structure of perception, right?",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2165,Everything becomes a game.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2166,"And not only that, a game you want to play.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2167,"And maybe in the final analysis, a game you'd want to play forever.",67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2168,"So you know, that's obviously a distant backening ideal.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2169,But we know games need rules.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2170,Or there's no play.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2171,Is there advice you can give?,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2172,"Now that we know the frame, to give to me, Lex about how to do this podcast better, how to do think about this world, how to be a good engineer, how to be a good human being from what you know.",193
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2173,Take your take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2174,It's a serious business.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2175,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2176,And that's part of that to circle back to the beginning.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2177,"Let's say that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss, which is obviously what you were doing when you went to Ukraine.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2178,It's like it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2179,"The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas, not as differentiated as it became.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2180,Sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed towards the abyss.,65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2181,And then you're traumatized.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2182,"If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.",52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2183,"The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2184,And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2185,"It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2186,"And the answer is, this terrible answer is yes, to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2187,"And then you might ask, well, why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2188,I'm innocent.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2189,And then the answer to that is even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed to the highest good.,100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2190,That's such an interesting distinction.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2191,Voluntary self.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2192,Voluntary.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2193,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2194,"Well, that's why the central Christian doctrine is pick up your cross and follow me.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2195,"And I'm speaking, not in religious terms, saying that.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2196,I'm just speaking as a psychologist.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2197,"It's like one of the things we've learned in the last 100 years is voluntary exposure to that, which freezes and terrifies you in measured proportions is curative.",163
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2198,So a form of at least in part involuntary suffering is depression.,66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2199,Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2200,You're a man who has suffered in this way.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2201,Perhaps continue to suffer in this way.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2202,How do you find a way out?,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2203,"The first thing I do as a clinician, if someone comes to me and says they're depressed, is ask myself a question, well, what does this person mean by that?",155
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2204,"So I have to find out, like, because maybe they're not depressed, maybe they're hyper anxious, or maybe they're obsessional, like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.",181
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2205,So they need to be differentiated.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2206,"But then the next question you have to ask is, well, are you depressed or do you have a terrible life?",102
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2207,Or is it some combination of the two?,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2208,"So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell, you don't have a terrible life.",77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2209,"You have friends, you have family, you have an intimate relationship, you have a job or a career, your body is educated as you should be given your intelligence, use your time outside of work wisely, you're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations.",252
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2210,You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense and all that's working.,81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2211,"Now, if you have all that and you're feeling really awful, you're either ill or you're depressed.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2212,And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route to that treatment of that.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2213,"My experience as being as a clinician is if you're depressed, but you have a life and you take an antidepressant, it will probably help you a lot.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2214,"Now, maybe you're not depressed exactly.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2215,You just have a terrible life.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2216,What does that look like?,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2217,"You have no relationship, your family is a mess, you've got no friends, you've got no plan, you've got no job.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2218,"Use your time outside of work not only badly but destructively, you have a drug or alcohol habit or some other vice pornography addiction.",138
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2219,You are completely unengaged in this around the community.,58
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2220,You have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you in your current mode of being or you move forward.,100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2221,"And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2222,"Well, if it's depression, per se, well, like I said, there's sometimes a biochemical route, a nutritional route.",112
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2223,There's ways that can be addressed.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2224,"It's probably physiological if you're at least in part, if you're depressed, but you have an okay life.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2225,Sometimes it's conceptual.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2226,You can turn to dreams.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2227,Sometimes to help people because dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.,82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2228,"And if your person is a real good dreamer and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2229,But that seems to be only true for more creative people.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2230,"And for the people who just have a terrible life, it's like, okay, you have a terrible life.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2231,"Well, let's pick a front.",25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2232,"How about you need, how about you need a friend, like one sort of friend?",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2233,Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2234,I'll have the person show me.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2235,So let's do it for a sec.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2236,So it's like this.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2237,"Hi, I'm Jordan.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2238,And people don't know how to do that.,37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2239,And then they can't even get the ball rolling.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2240,"For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.",55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2241,"Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2242,"You know, and there's these elementary social skills that, hypothetically, if you were well-cared for, you learned when you were like three.",140
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2243,"And sometimes people have, I had lots of clients to whom no one ever paid any attention.",88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2244,"And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2245,"And some of that was just listening because they had 10,000 hours of conversations they never had with anyone.",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2246,And they were all tangled up in their head.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2247,"And they had to just one client, in particular, I worked with this person for 15 years.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2248,And what she wanted from me was for me just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes.,79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2249,It was very hard for me.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2250,And to just tell me what had happened to her.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2251,"And then what happened at the end of the conversation, then I could discuss a bit with her.",91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2252,"And then as we progressed through the years, the amount of time that we spent in discussion increased in proportion in this session.",132
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2253,"Until by the time we stopped seeing each other when my clinical practice collapsed, we were talking about 80% of the time.",122
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2254,"But she literally, she'd never been attended to properly ever.",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2255,"And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2256,She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords that separated the wheat from the chaff.,90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2257,And so you can do that in therapy.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2258,"If you're listening and you're depressed, I would say if you can find a therapist, and that's getting harder and harder, because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now, because you have to agree with your clients, which is a terrible thing to do with them.",268
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2259,"Just like it's terrible, just arbitrarily oppose them.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2260,You could do the self-authoring program online.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2261,It helps you write an autobiography.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2262,"And so if you have memories that are more than 18 months old, the bother you when you think them up, part of you is locked inside that.",135
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2263,An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2264,That's a metaphorical way of thinking about it.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2265,That's why it still has emotional significance.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2266,"So you can write about your past experiences, but I would say wait for at least 18 months if something bad has happened to you, because otherwise you just hurt yourself again by encountering it.",194
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2267,You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.,56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2268,There's an analysis of faults in virtues.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2269,That's the present authoring.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2270,And then there's a guided writing exercise that helps you make a future plan.,77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2271,"That's young men who do that, you could go to college.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2272,"Young men who do that, 90 minutes, just the future authoring, 90 minutes.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2273,They're 50% less likely to drop out.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2274,That's all it takes.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2275,So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2276,"You said, I salute, make a friend.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2277,"Oh man, sometimes the first step is extremely difficult.",56
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2278,"Oh my god, sometimes it's way worse than that.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2279,"I had clients who were so depressed, they literally couldn't get out of bed.",76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2280,So what's their first step?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2281,"It's like, can you sit up once today?",37
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2282,No.,3
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2283,Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2284,"Like you just, you scale back the dragon till you find one that's comparable that moves you forward.",100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2285,There's a rubric for life.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2286,Scale back the dragons till you find one comparable and it'll give you a little bit of goal.,92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2287,"Commensurate with the struggle, but the plus side of that, because that's you think that, God, that's depressing.",113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2288,You may not have to start by sitting up while you do if you can't sit up.,73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2289,"But the plus side of that is it's the peritone distribution issue is that aggregates exponentially increase and failures due to, by the way, but aggregates exponentially increase.",179
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2290,"So once you start the ball rolling, it can get zipping along pretty good.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2291,"This person that I talked about was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe when we first met just talking even though I was her therapist, but by the end she was doing stand-up comedy.",184
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2292,"So it took years, but still, most people won't do stand-up comedy.",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2293,That's quite the bloody achievement.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2294,She would read her poetry on stage too.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2295,"So for someone who was petrified into paralysis by social anxiety and who had to start very small, there's a hell of an accomplishment.",135
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2296,"Yeah, it all starts with one step.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2297,Do you have advice for young people?,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2298,"In high school, you've given a lot of people a cup to you for advice, for strength, for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.",142
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2299,Take on some responsibility.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2300,Do something for other people.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2301,"You're doing something for yourself while you're doing that, even if you don't know it, for sure, because you're a community across time.",137
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2302,Find something to serve.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2303,Somebody to help.,17

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2311,You don't know anything.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2312,You could be the boss of your job.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2313,"If you're working in a grocery store, you're working in a convenience store, assuming you're not working for a terrified tyrant, you can be nice to the customers.",162

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2315,You can learn how to handle boss employee relationship.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2316,You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2317,"You can learn in an entry-level job, man, and I'll tell you, if you take an entry-level job and you learn, and it's a reasonably decent place, you will not be in an entry-level job for long, because everyone who's competent is desperate for competent people.",258
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2318,"If you go and show yourself as competent, there'll be a trial period, but if you go show yourself as competent, all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there will start opening like mad.",191
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2319,"You strive for competence, for craftsmanship.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2320,"Yeah, for discipline.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2321,"I said in one of the chapters, my books is focused on putting your house in order.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2322,"It's like, well, how do you start?",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2323,Make your bed.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2324,It actually took me quite a long time in my life before I made my bed regularly in the morning.,95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2325,"Most of my life was pretty good order, but that was one thing I didn't have in order.",85
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2326,My clothes and my closet as well.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2327,All that's in order.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2328,Not all of it.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2329,"I'm cleaning out some drawers right now, but look around and see what bugs you in your room.",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2330,Just look.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2331,"It's like, okay, I'm in my room.",32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2332,Do I like this room?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2333,"No, it bugs me.",15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2334,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2335,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2336,"Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there and the carpet's dirty, and that corner's kind of ugly, and the light there isn't very good, and my clothes clothes it's a mess, so I don't even like to open it.",214
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2337,"Okay, that's a lot of problems.",31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2338,That sucks.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2339,That's a lot of opportunity.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2340,Pick something and fix it.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2341,Something that bugs you.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2342,"Yeah, but not too much.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2343,So the rule is pick something that you know would make.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2344,Pick a problem.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2345,Pick a solution to it that you know wouldn't help that you could do that you would do.,86
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2346,So you have to negotiate with yourself.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2347,"It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2348,How do you know?,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2349,I've been in here for 10 years and I've never cleaned it up.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2350,"It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.",59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2351,Would you clean one drawer?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2352,Find out.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2353,"And so imagine now you want to be happy when you open that drawer and you think, well, that's stupid.",101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2354,"It's like, is it?",17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2355,"Maybe it's your sock drawer, which I cleaned up in my room the other day.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2356,"By the way, you're going to, you're going to open that every morning.",69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2357,That's like 30 seconds of your life every day.,46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2358,Okay.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2359,So that's three minutes a week.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2360,That's 12 minutes a month.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2361,That's two hours a year.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2362,So maybe your life is made out.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2363,"If you got 16 hours a day, let's figure this out.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2364,"512 in an hour, 12 in an hour, 144 in 12 hours.",47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2365,"Yeah, let's say 200, 200, five minute chunks.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2366,That's your life.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2367,"There's a gentleman, Jordan Peterson did just some math how many five minute chunks there are in a day.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2368,And I got it.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2369,It's pretty accurate.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2370,It's approximately right.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2371,"So you got 200, five minute chunks and they repeat a lot of them repeat.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2372,"So if you get every one of those right, they're trivial, right?",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2373,Who cares?,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2374,What my sock drawer looks like?,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2375,"It's fair enough, man, but that's your life.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2376,The things you repeat every day.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2377,"The mundane things, I think I could get all those mundane things right.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2378,That's the game rules.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2379,"It's like, now the mundane is in place.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2380,Now you can play because all the mundane is in place.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2381,And this is actually true.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2382,"So with children, imagine you want your children to play.",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2383,"Well, play is very fragile, neurologically.",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2384,Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2385,So everything has to be in order.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2386,Everything has to be a walled garden before the children will play.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2387,That's a good way of thinking about it.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2388,"So you put everything in order and you think, oh my god, now I'm tyrannized by this order.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2389,"It's like, no, you aren't.",26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2390,Not if it's voluntary.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2391,And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2392,And so then all of a sudden you get all these things in order.,62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2393,"It's like, oh, look at this.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2394,I've got some room to play here.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2395,And then then maybe you're not depressed.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2396,"Now it's it's often not that simple, you know, it's not that simple.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2397,Try putting your room in order.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2398,Perfect order.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2399,That's hard.,12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2400,"I mean, it's a really powerful way to think about those five minute chunks.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2401,Just get one of them right in a day.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2402,"Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days, your life is in order.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2403,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2404,"You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2405,So a lot of them would come home from work.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2406,"The guy is saying, and their wife would meet them at the door and it'd be a fight right away.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2407,"You know, and it's a clash there because he comes home and he's tired and hungry.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2408,"And he's worked all day and he's hoping that, you know, he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home.",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2409,But then the wife is at home and she's been with the kids all day and she's tired and hungry.,93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2410,"And she's hoping that when he comes home, he'll show her some appreciation for what's happened today.",101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2411,And then the clash and then they both have problems to discuss because they've had their troubles during the day.,113
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2412,"And so then every time they get together, they are not like, it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes.",98
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2413,And then the whole evening is screwed.,38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2414,"And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2415,It's knock on the door.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2416,We'll open.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2417,"Okay, you get to pick how what happens when you come home, but you have to figure out what it is.",97
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2418,So now this is the deal.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2419,You treat yourself properly.,28

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2449,"And then now you got two visions and you say, well, what would you like?",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2450,"And you listen and she says, what would you like?",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2451,And you tell her?,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2452,"And then you think, can how can we bring these visions together?",64
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2453,"So not only do we both get what we want, but because we've brought them together, we even get more than we want.",112

"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2456,It's not a compromise.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2457,It's a union of ideals.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2458,That's even makes a better ideal.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2459,"And then you get to come home and then then there's another rule that goes along with that, which is, please, dear, have the grace to allow me to do this stupidly and badly.",173
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2460,"Well, I learned at least 20 times.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2461,And I'll give you the same leeway.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2462,And then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times and we'll talk about it.,70
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2463,"And then maybe we'll get it right for the next 10,000 times.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2464,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2465,"And you can do that with your whole, you can do that with your whole life and you can do that with your kids and you can do that with your family.",146
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2466,"I can't, it's not easy, but you can do.",39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2467,It's a lot easier than the alternative.,39
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2468,Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2469,How do you find on that topic the love of your life?,52
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2470,That's a good question.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2471,"I was asked that multiple times on my tour, three times in a row.",65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2472,"In fact, because we ask people to use this slide.",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2473,"Oh, gadget.",11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2474,That's a popular question too.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2475,Very.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2476,It always came up to the top.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2477,And I got asked that three times in a row.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2478,And I did to have a good answer.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2479,"And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2480,"I thought, Oh, I know why?",26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2481,Because that's a stupid question.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2482,"So, so why?",11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2483,Yeah.,5
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2484,Why?,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2485,Because it's putting the cart before the horse.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2486,Here's the right question.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2487,How do I make myself into the perfect date?,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2488,You answer that question and you will not have any problem answering the previous question.,91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2489,"It's like, what I want in a partner.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2490,Mm-hmm.,7
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2491,"If I offered everything I could do a partner, who would I be?",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2492,You work on that.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2493,Ask that question.,18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2494,Just ask.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2495,"Just ask yourself, okay, I have to be the person that women would want.",71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2496,"Okay, what do they want?",24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2497,Clean.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2498,That's not a bad start.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2499,Reasonably good physical shape.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2500,"So healthy, productive, generous, honest, willing to delay gratification.",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2501,So you dance with a woman.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2502,"It's like, what's she doing?",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2503,What are you two doing?,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2504,"Well, it's a patterned, your, there's patterns happening around you.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2505,"That's the music patterns, patterns of being.",45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2506,That's the music.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2507,"Now, can you align yourself with the patterns of being gracefully?",66
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2508,That's what she's checking out.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2509,And then can you do that with her?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2510,And then can you do that in a playful and attentive manner and keep your bloody hands to yourself for at least a minute?,120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2511,And so can you dance in a playful manner?,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2512,It's like you can go through this in your imagination.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2513,"And you know, you'll know, you know.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2514,"And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?",57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2515,"And the answer is usually, man, it's pretty horrible, abyss separating you from that ideal.",91
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2516,"But the harder you work on offering other people what they need and want, the more people will line up to play with you.",120
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2517,And so it's the wrong question.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2518,"It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?",50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2519,"And then you think, well, if I do that, people will just take advantage of me.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2520,"And that's the non-naive objection, right?",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2521,"Because the naive person think, well, I'll be good and everyone will treat me right.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2522,"It's like the cynic says, no, I'll be good and someone will take me out.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2523,"And then you think, well, what do you do about that objection?",62
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2524,"And the answer is, well, you factor that in.",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2525,"And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?",49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2526,As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2527,"It's like, I know your full of snakes.",38
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2528,I know it.,10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2529,Maybe I know it more than you do.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2530,But we'll play anyways.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2531,And that's the risk.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2532,That's right.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2533,"Voluntarily, right?",19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2534,"It's like, and what's so cool about that is that even though the person you're dealing with is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.",190
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2535,And that's true.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2536,Even I dealt with people who are pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic and sometimes dangerously so.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2537,"And you tread very lightly when you're dealing with someone like that, especially if they're intoxicated.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2538,And even then your best bet is that alert trust.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2539,It's the only fact.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2540,"The only thing I know that if I had one client who is a paranoid, he was paranoid psychopath.",93
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2541,That's a bad combination.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2542,"He was a bad guy, man.",22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2543,He had like four restraining orders on him and restraining orders don't work on the sort of people that you put restraining orders on.,134
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2544,And he used to be harassed now.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2545,"And then by, you know, a bureaucrat in a bank with with delusions of power.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2546,"And he would say to them, he he used that kind of act this out to me when I was talking to him, he'd say, I'm going to be here worst night.",139
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2547,And he meant it.,16
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2548,And he would do it.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2549,"He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt and paranoid people are hyperacute.",135
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2550,So they're watching you for any sign of deceit or manipulation.,63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2551,And they're really good at it.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2552,Because like they're 100% that's what paranoia is.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2553,It's 100% focus on that.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2554,"And even under those circumstances, if you step carefully enough, you can maybe you can avoid the acts.",103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2555,That's a good thing to know if you ever meet someone truly dangerous.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2556,Absolutely.,11
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2557,"I believe in that that being fragile nevertheless, taking that leap of trust towards another person, even when they're dangerous, especially when they're dangerous.",164
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2558,"If you care, if there's something there in those hills you want to find, then that's probably the only way you're going to find is taking that risk.",148
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2559,I have to ask you about Gu-Lag Archipelago by Sol-Je-Nitsen.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2560,Let's speak to this very point.,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2561,There's so many layers of this book we could talk about it forever.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2562,I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.,54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2563,"But there is sort of one of the themes captured in a few ways that was described to the book is that line between good and evil that runs through every human being as he writes, the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.",254
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2564,"During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing place.",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2565,"Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil, and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish.",119
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2566,One in the same human being is at various ages under various circumstances a totally different human being.,107
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2567,"At times he's close to being a devil at times the sainthood, but his name doesn't change.",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2568,To that name we're described the whole lot good and evil.,57
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2569,What do you think about this line?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2570,"What do you think about this thing when we talked about if you give somebody a chance, you actually bring out the best of them?",127
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2571,What do you think about this other aspect that throughout time that lines shifts inside each person and you get to define that shift?,133
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2572,What do you think about this line?,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2573,Are we all capable of evil?,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2574,"Well, you know, the cosmic drama that's Satan versus Christ is like, well, who's that about?",92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2575,If it's not about you.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2576,"I'm speaking just as a psychologist or as a literary critic, those are characters at least they're that.",104
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2577,Are they human characters?,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2578,"Well, obviously, are they archetypal human characters?",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2579,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2580,What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?,49
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2581,I don't know.,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2582,Is the world a story?,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2583,"Maybe, but the way stores are often told is the characters embody a stable.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2584,Those are those are unsophistic not great literature though.,60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2585,It's very rare in great literature.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2586,"What you have in great literature generally is the internal drama, right?",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2587,"In as the literature becomes more pop, I would say, the characters are more unitary.",84
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2588,So there's a real bad guy and he's all bad and there's a real good guy and he's all good.,89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2589,And that's not as interesting.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2590,It's not as sophisticated.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2591,"If when you reach Dostoevsky and Heights in literary representation or Shakespearean Heights, you can identify with the villain.",128
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2592,And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle in some sense.,69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2593,And also the characters change throughout.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2594,They shift throughout.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2595,They're unpredictable throughout and taking the speaking of Russian more seriously recently.,92
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2596,And I've got the talk to translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and Chakhov and those kinds of folks.,100
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2597,And you get to one of the mistakes that translators made with Dostoevsky for the longest time is they would quote unquote fix the chaotic mess that is Dostoevsky because there was a sense like he was too rushed in his writing.,226
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2598,It seemed like there was tangents that had nothing to do with anything.,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2599,The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2600,"There's parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete, that kind of stuff.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2601,And what they realize that is that's not that's actually crafted that way.,74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2602,"It's not, you know, it's like editing James Joyce like Finnegan's Wake or something because it doesn't make any sense.",118
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2603,They realize that that is the magic of it.,42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2604,That captures the humanity of these characters that they are unpredictable.,75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2605,They change throughout time.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2606,There's a bunch of contradictions.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2607,"On which point I got to ask, is there a case to be made that Brothers Karmazov is the greatest book of a read?",110
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2608,"Yeah, there's a case to be made for that.",41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2609,"I don't know, is it better than crime and punishment?",53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2610,"Yes, yeah.",10
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2611,You think so?,13
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2612,"Why do you, I'm not arguing with it.",36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2613,Why do you think that?,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2614,"Well, it's every book is a person.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2615,Some of my best friends are inside that book.,45
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2616,"Yeah, it's an amazing book.",27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2617,There's no doubt about it.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2618,I think it's some books are defined by your personal relationship with them.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2619,"And that one was definitive and I almost graduated to that one because for the longest time, the idiot was my favorite book of all because I identified with ideas represented by Prince Michigan.",194
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2620,I don't know if I identified.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2621,"Oh, that's interesting.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2622,To Prince Michigan as a human being.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2623,The Holy Fool.,14
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2624,The Fool.,9
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2625,"Because the world, kind of my whole life still kind of sees me saw me in my perception.",87
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2626,My narrow perception is kind of the fool.,41
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2627,And I different from the interpretation that a lot of people take of this book.,79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2628,"I see him as a kind of hero to be definitely to be a naive quote unquote fool, but really just the naive optimist and naïve in the best possible way.",149
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2629,I do believe that that's childlike.,35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2630,"Yeah, childlike is a better.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2631,So naïve is usually seen as it's childish naïve.,48
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2632,"Yeah, but childlike.",20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2633,That's why no one enters the kingdom of heaven unless they become like a child.,79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2634,That's Prince Michigan.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2635,"Dusty, you knew that.",21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2636,So that's why you like the idiot.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2637,That's so interesting.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2638,"See, I think I like Kremlin punishment because while you identified with Michigan, I think I identified more with Raskolnikov because I was tempted by Luciferin intellect in a manner that in a manner very similar to the manner he was tempted.",242
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2639,"But I mean, I think you can make a case that the brother's Kremlin is obvious.",78
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2640,Dostyelsky's crowning achievement.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2641,"Well, that's something, man.",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2642,He ruined literature for me.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2643,Because everything else just fell in sip it afterwards.,55
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2644,Not everything.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2645,Not everything.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2646,I found some books that in my experience hit that pinnacle.,59
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2647,The master in Margarita.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2648,That's a deadly book.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2649,"I read that I think four times and I still, there's still, it's unbelievably deep.",82
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2650,There's a Nikos Kuzanzakis Greek writer.,40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2651,"Some of his books are, his writing is amazing.",46
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2652,As well.,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2653,Did you ever connect with the literary existentialist Kamu or people like Herman Hesse or even Kafka?,101
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2654,Did you ever connect with those?,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2655,To the same degree?,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2656,"Yeah, to the same.",18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2657,Enough to be an influence.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2658,"You know, you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense, not to encounters a great dead friend and failed to learn.",115
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2659,"I mean, I tried to separate the wheat from the chaff when I read, you know, when I read all the great clinicians, all of them, perhaps not.",139
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2660,Those who are foremost in the pantheon and I tried to pull out what I could and that was a lot.,95
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2661,I learned a lot from Freud.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2662,I learned a lot from Rogers and I learned a lot from well from Dostyelsky and Nietzsche.,88
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2663,I'm going to do a course on Dostyelsky and Nietzsche for this Peterson Academy.,79
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2664,This is coming up in January.,29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2665,"Oh, that'll be done together.",29
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2666,I'm really looking forward to it.,33
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2667,You're weaving.,15
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2668,"I mean, I hadn't thought about doing them together.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2669,"Oh, that'd be fun.",18
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2670,That's a good idea.,19
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2671,"Well, there's an interesting idea.",34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2672,You often weave them together really masterfully because there is there is religious in the broad sense of that word themes throughout the writing of both.,155
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2673,"Yeah, there's uncanny parallelisms in their writing and their lives.",68
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2674,"So, and Dostyelsky's deeper than Nietzsche, but that's because he was a writer of fiction.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2675,Nietzsche is almost the character in a dusty eski.,50
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2676,He is definitely that.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2677,He is definitely that.,22
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2678,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2679,And apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostyelsky than people had thought.,76
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2680,There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.,53
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2681,Dostyelsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche as far as I know.,65
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2682,I could be wrong about that.,28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2683,"But the thing that Dostyelsky had over Nietzsche is Nietzsche had to make things propositional in some real sense, because he was a philosopher.",144
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2684,"And it's hard to propositionize things that are outside your can, but you can characterize them.",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2685,"And so in the brothers Karamazov, Ivan is a more developed character than alliocia in the explicit sense.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2686,"He can make better arguments, but alliocia wins like Michigan because he's the better man.",90
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2687,And Dostyelsky can show that in the actions.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2688,Right.,6
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2689,"He can't render it entirely propositional, but that's probably because what's good can't be rendered entirely propositional.",124
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2690,And so Dostyelsky had that edge over Nietzsche.,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2691,"I said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist, atheist materialist and puts forward an argument on that front that's still unparalleled as far as I'm concerned.",163
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2692,"And overwhelms alliocia who cannot respond, but alliocia is still the better man.",81
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2693,"So which is very interesting, you know, that what you know the funny thing about those two characters is you Jordan Peterson seem to be somebody that at least imparted bodies both, because you are one of the intellectuals of our time, rigorous and thought, but also are able to have that kind of OG describe.",308
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2694,"If you remove the religiosity of Arrocia, there's what's a good word love towards the world spirit of encouragement.",116
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2695,Yes.,4
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2696,"Which yeah, well, it's it's, you know, one of the things I did learn perhaps from looking into the abyss to the degree that I have had to or was willing to was that at some level you have to make a fundamental statement of faith when God creates the world after each day, he says, he saw that it was good.",305
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2697,"You think, well, is it good?",28
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2698,"It's like, well, there's a tough question.",42
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2699,"Now, you know, do you want to bring a child into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question of whether or not it's good?",131
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2700,"It's an act of faith to declare that it's good, because the evidence is ambivalent.",83
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2701,"And so then you think, okay, well, am I going to act as if it's good?",69
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2702,And what would happen if I did?,31
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2703,"And maybe the answer to that is, I think this is the answer.",60
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2704,"The more you act out the proposition that it's good, the better it gets.",72
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2705,And so that's it.,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2706,"Dostoevsky said, this is something else.",40
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2707,"Every man is not only responsible for everything he does, but for everything everyone else does.",96
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2708,"It's like, what is that profounder?",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2709,Are you just insane?,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2710,"Then you think, is what you receive back proportionate to what you deliver?",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2711,And the answer to that might be yes.,36
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2712,That's a terrifying idea.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2713,"And it's certainly, you can see that it's true in some sense, because people certainly respond to you in kind with how you treat that's certainly the case.",155
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2714,It's terrifying and it's exciting.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2715,"Yeah, right.",12
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2716,"That's an adventure, isn't it?",30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2717,You create the world by the way you live it.,44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2718,The world you experience is defined by the way you live that world.,67
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2719,And that's really interesting.,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2720,"And then taking as a collective, we create the world together in that way.",74
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2721,What do you think is the meaning of it all?,43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2722,"What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2723,"We've defined it many, many times throughout this conversation.",63
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2724,"The adventure along the route, man.",35
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2725,"And I would say, where's that adventure to be found in faith?",61
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2726,What's the faith?,17
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2727,"The highest values love and truth is its hand made in that's a statement of faith, right?",89
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2728,Because you can't tell.,23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2729,You have to act it out to see if it's if it's true.,51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2730,"And so you can't even find out without, and that's so peculiar, you have to make the commitment a priori.",105
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2731,It's like a marriage.,21
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2732,It's the same thing.,20
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2733,"It's like, well, is this the person for me?",43
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2734,That's the wrong question.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2735,How do I find out if this is the person for me?,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2736,"By binding myself to them, well, maybe the same thing's true life, right?",73
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2737,You bind yourself to it.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2738,"And that tighter you bind yourself to it, the more you find out what it is.",75
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2739,And that's like a radical embrace.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2740,And it's a really radical embrace.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2741,That's the crucifix symbol.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2742,"And more than that, because, like I said, the full passion story isn't death.",77
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2743,It isn't even unjust death.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2744,"It isn't even unjust death and the crucifixion of the innocent, which is really getting pretty bad.",99
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2745,"It's unjust, torturous, innocent death, attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.",94
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2746,"Well, that's a hell of the thing to radically embrace.",54
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2747,"It's like, bring it on.",23
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2748,I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal and think they can get to that ideal while living in a place of cynicism and ultimately escape from life and hiding from life afraid of life.,196
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2749,And it's a beautifully put that love is the highest ideal to reach for.,71
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2750,And truth is it's handmade.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2751,"I thought about that for a long time, right?",44
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2752,This hierarchy of ideal.,24
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2753,"And the thing about truth, that bitter truth, let's say that cynical truth is it can break the shackles of naivety.",115
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2754,"And actually, a burnt cynicism is a moral improvement over a blind naivety, even though one is in some ways positive, but only because it's protected.",150
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2755,"And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.",51
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2756,But you're not done at that point.,34
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2757,You're just barely started.,27
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2758,It's like you're cynical.,25
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2759,You're not cynical enough.,26
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2760,It's like how cynical are you?,30
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2761,Are you?,8
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2762,I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?,47
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2763,Because you have to be you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds before you find that part of you.,103
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2764,But you can find it if you want.,32
"Jordan Peterson: Life, Death, Power, Fame, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #313",2765,"And then you think, well, I want to stop this.",46
