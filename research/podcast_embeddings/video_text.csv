test_video,0, Good morning guys and welcome back to the channel you'll have to excuse me.,76
test_video,1,I've been back two days and I'm now full of cold so I don't know how this is going to go but yeah welcome back to the channel and welcome to my bedroom.,152
test_video,2,So I've got a pretty busy couple of days ahead with work related stuff so I'm not going to be able to do this so I thought I'd try and do it now quickly before I go out to work.,177
test_video,3,So a lot of you have been asking for me to do a video on my thoughts and feelings with regards to my experience in Doha for the World Cup.,138
test_video,4,So that's what I'm going to do.,31
test_video,5,So first and foremost before the World Cup started we had this this media narrative from the British media they'd constructed this narrative around Katar not being a safe place with regards to their laws their beliefs their being no alcohol etc etc etc and my honest opinion is having been there the media got it completely wrong okay and of course everyone's going to say oh 6000 people died.,393
test_video,6,"Actually if you look at the statistics there wasn't 6000 deaths but those those deaths that are being talked about are throughout the whole migrant population that have been living in Katar since 2012 so that's bus drivers train drivers rest drunk workers but you know heart attack strokes normal everyday migrant workers who live there okay these people weren't all on the construction sites they were just normal everyday migrant workers that were living in Katar at the time so all those deaths have been recorded and as they would be they're just normal people but they weren't all on the construction sites so that again was misinformation I think it was 5000 and something people have died since 2012 as I said of the migrant population but they weren't all just workers on the construction sites some of those were people that had been there for many years people in their 50s 60s 70s heart attacks and strokes and all the rest of it so that was misinformation to start with anyway moving on from that let's talk about the accommodation again the first thing I saw when the Wilkup started all over social media were people uploading pictures of these cabins at the fanzones these shipping containers these old shipping containers that were out in the middle of the desert and there was no food and the food that was being served was cold burgers at 25 dollars a time or whatever people were saying and actually I didn't see any of that and I stayed at one of the fanzones the free fanzone and I stayed in one of these shipping containers and I had absolutely no issues there was air con there was a mobile air con unit there was a fan there was electric there was power points there was a bed there was a hot shower it was clean was everything you need I think the only issue if I'm going to be picky if I'm going to be pedantic was maybe the price that they were nearly 200 pound a night but having said that it's a Wilkup in the middle east you're going to pay a premium you're going to pay a little bit more than we would pay in the UK or other places because it's the middle east and because it's a Wilkup I remember excuse me I remember working at an event down in south Wales for the champions league several years ago and we were staying at a campsite and that was 80 pound a night to pitch your tent on a campsite so again I think it was unfair criticism and the media had gone out of their way really to find people that had perhaps had a bad experience because I didn't see any of that the food at the fan village the food was great you know there was a star box there was several burger places there was a falafel place there was Arabic food and again yes it was a little bit pricey but we're talking about a world cup and we're in the middle east people go to Dubai and spend three or four thousand pound on a holiday for a long weekend and nobody complains and actually who built Dubai how was Dubai built over the last 25 years by a migrant workforce you know so again the likes of these pundits Gary Linnaker and so on he was sat on TV complaining and saying that the Wilkup shouldn't be in Qatar you've only got to put Gary Linnaker put Gary Linnaker in Dubai into Google and you'll see him on holiday pictures of him on holiday in Dubai and Dubai was built by a migrant workforce so for me it's complete hypocrisy from the start from the get-go and that was part of the reason why I wanted to go there because I wanted to see it for myself so yeah so the fan village absolutely fine but perhaps a little bit pricey so moving on from the accommodation we then have the transportation around Doha so they'd actually built a metro system specifically for the Wilkup and it was brilliant you could get on it at the airport and then it would go to various different places around the city and all those stops all those places those stations were very excuse me we're very near to a stadium apart from I think it was the Albaite stadium which was at the end of the metro line but then you could get a shuttle bus and the shuttle buses were they were just there all the time you could jump straight off the train and straight on to a shuttle bus and you'd be at the stadium within 20 minutes other than that I could get to pretty much any stadium any Wilkup stadium from where I was staying at the fan zone within an hour so again when you look at it logistically that the Wilkup was it was perfect you didn't have to travel you know four or five hours across the country you didn't have to travel to a different country or to a different state all the stadiums were in one city so for me that was absolutely fantastic you know it was so easy to travel between the games to them from the games so again why why this wasn't reported I don't know probably because it was one of the positive factors about the Wilkup and of course the media don't want to talk about anything positive to do with Qatar and then there was the Qatari people who I actually found to be very friendly so I was very lucky that I had two two or three occasions where I was able to sit down and talk with local Qataris and the first one was on the first day actually I was walking around Sorkwakif and I got shot into a Qatari gentleman he was probably in his early 60s and he asked me if I'd eaten and at that point I hadn't so he invited me for dinner in a local restaurant we went to the restaurant we sat down we had dinner we had really interesting conversation we were talking about Qatar and the UK and lots of different things I then wanted to pay for the meal however the waiter said that they couldn't accept card payments so I asked where the nearest ATM was and the Qatari guy he paid for the meal he did so he didn't know me he didn't know anything about me other than the 15 minute conversation we'd had paid for my meal he shook my hand and he wished me all the best and off he went and I never saw him again and the second occasion was at the Argentina Argentina V Croatia game I think it was like Argentina were playing anyway at the Lucille stadium and I was sat next to two much younger Qatari guys who were absolutely brilliant again very friendly very open had quite a good knowledge of football of the Premier League they knew who all the players played for they knew about the Premier League they knew about you know the Spanish teams Italian teams they were very knowledgeable guys so this again this idea that Qatar is not a footballing nation well it probably isn't because they only have a population of three million and only 300 thousand of those are Qataris so it's not like they can have their own leagues and stuff like that but it doesn't mean they don't watch football they're not interested in football because these two Qatari guys clearly were and they knew a lot more than me about the Premier League so and again we spoke about all sorts of different things and we probably spent more time talking than we did watching the football so again you know my experience there it was a positive experience they were friendly they were generous and they were quite outgoing and willing to talk about anything and the last thing I want to talk about guys is this whole thing around alcohol and alcohol not being served or allowed in Qatar again this was complete and utter nonsense okay you could get alcohol in any licensed bar in Qatar and those licensed bars would normally be in the hotels and there's lots of hotels in Doha so you could go into any hotel and be served alcohol whether it was Lago whether it was Sida gin whiskey cocktails and also you could go down to any of the beach clubs I did a video on B12 the B12 Beach Club and again they had a selection of different alcohols you could buy from beer to Sida to cocktails whiskey all the rest of it so there was no issue with drinking alcohol in Qatar but it had to be in a licensed bar in a hotel or a private beach you couldn't drink on the street and you couldn't drink at the stadiums but you could also drink at the fanzones okay so I think what most of the fans were doing were getting tanked up beforehand and then going to the game but the only difference was you couldn't drink at the stadium which again it's neither here nor there it's not a massive problem but the media beforehand all they were talking about was no alcohol no alcohol you can't drink in Qatar I remember reading a story about a guy who walked seven miles to get a beer now I don't even know where the Qatar is seven miles wide where they got that story from I will never know because to walk seven miles in that he in Doha you would probably die and allegedly this guy walked seven miles to find somewhere to have a beer and unbelievable for me that's just total BS and I don't believe it and I think again it was all part of this instructed narrative to tarnish the reputation of Qatar before the World Cup had even started so yeah unbelievable and it just goes to show how hypocritical and biased the Western media can be because all the Western media they were out there they were staying in five star hotels they were flown out their business class Qatar Airways five star hotels show for driven around they were getting a free holiday out of it and getting paid nicely so to then sit there on tv and and make the accusations and statements that they made for me was completely hypocritical and I'm not a political person and I don't I try not to get involved in these types of things but this is the first time in my life I've seen first hand how the media can manipulate something to fit their narrative okay so anyway guys I feel like I'm probably waffling on a bit now I've got to go to work apologies if this video sounds absolutely atrocious but I'm full of cold I've been back two days but I hope it gives you some clarification with regards to how the World Cup really was it was a positive experience for me I will return to Qatar my only regret is that I didn't go for the group games I didn't go for longer because there's so much more I could have done and yeah that's it so guys again thanks for all the support thanks for liking, sharing and subscribing if you haven't done already hit that subscribe button now and I'll see you soon thanks for watching guys",10238
