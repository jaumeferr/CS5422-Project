1,Got any answers?,16
2,"Oh, I'm not quite so sure about that.",37
3,I'm not sure how this movie ends.,33
4,This is the dumbest fucking movie I've ever seen.,49
5,Do you know magic the gathering is now racist?,46
6,I don't even know what magic the gathering is.,46
7,It's some dirty game that nerds play.,37
8,Oh.,3
9,How is it racist?,17
10,I don't know.,13
11,I just read.,12
12,I only saw the title of the article that they're trying to cancel magic the gathering.,86
13,"I'm like, oh Christ.",20
14,I thought that's what you guys liked.,37
15,I thought they liked magic the gathering.,41
16,I have no idea.,15
17,Everything's problematic.,25
18,Everyone's getting canceled.,28
19,It's amazing how many people did blackface.,43
20,"Yeah, it's very strange.",24
21,It's very strange.,18
22,It's very strange.,18
23,"It was on Primetime TV, right?",30
24,Yeah.,5
25,A bunch of times.,17
26,Yeah.,5
27,"I mean, like in the modern world, Primetime TV.",47
28,"Jimmy Fallon was doing, well, he's doing a Chris Roth impression, which by the way, he used to be able to do when I was in high school.",135
29,My friends were Mr. T for Halloween.,36
30,Nobody gave a fuck.,19
31,"Nobody was like, Jimmy, what's wrong with you?",46
32,"Everybody's like, oh, you're Mr. T for Halloween.",49
33,It was never like a problem.,28
34,"It's very, it's a very strange thing.",37
35,"You know, like you can do whiteface.",36
36,No problem.,11
37,Here it is.,11
38,What is magic the gathering?,28
39,And vote prejudice card.,24
40,"So that's a, it's an enchantment card.",38
41,It restricts the castors opponent's only using summons that match the skin color of their opposing creatures.,109
42,Huh?,4
43,This is you.,12
44,"If you brought me on to talk about this, I should leave now about about magic the gathering.",92
45,"This is why I'm here, man.",26
46,We're in a bad way.,19
47,It just shows how fucked up everything is.,42
48,"There's a lot of thin skin out there right now, apparently.",59
49,"I just don't, I mean, it seems like a perfect storm.",52
50,"Like if you wanted to engineer the downfall of society, you would do it in several steps.",89
51,"You would have a reality show president where everybody's mad at him and then all the liberals get their feathers in a ruffle and everybody gets real super uptight and then there's this big divide between the left and the right that's kind of, you know, manufactured and then you'd have this disease.",300
52,Just lock everyone inside.,26
53,"Yeah, unprecedented.",20
54,Lock shut down the economy.,27
55,Force people to not work.,25
56,"So if your business falls apart, you could be the most hard work and diligent, disciplined person who's always at work, our early, always has your eyes dot in your teeth crossed and you still go broke and you're still fucked.",225
57,"And then you have this George Floyd thing and then boom, it just ignites the power's gig.",89
58,"The other thing that you have to wrap around all this is this social media, which is, you know, I'm only going to post things that are just going to completely make everyone that sees whatever I'm posting emotional and and filled with rage, whether you're on the left or you're on the right, my goal is to enrage people.",320
59,That's the goal.,16
60,And then that just gets spun up over and over.,46
61,So you're taking all these little incidents and you're multiplying times thousands and thousands of views.,106
62,No.,3
63,"And then on top of that mainstream media is the same thing, right?",66
64,"It's not like there's this huge difference between what the mainstream media shows and what social media, they're both is both emotional media.",143
65,"They're trying to make people emotional, which is the worst possible thing.",75
66,No one makes good decisions when they're emotional.,51
67,No.,3
68,I spent my adult life trying to train humans to not get emotional in pressure situations.,89
69,Why?,4
70,"Because it's going to end up bad every single time, every single time.",70
71,And yet that's what our that's what our society is based on right now.,70
72,But it's based on these emotional reactions.,44
73,Yeah.,5
74,"Because of social media, I think, and because of things like YouTube and user created content where anybody can kind of make videos, so many things are vying for folks' attention that mainstream media has resorted to click baity type shit, whether it's New York Times articles, which you know used to be beyond reproach, that they've gone social justice warrior and click baity.",378
75,And all these other websites are 100% click baity.,50
76,That's the only way they can get people to pay attention.,57
77,"Like I saw like the dumbest fucking article, I couldn't believe how dumb it was.",80
78,It was an article on Ozark.,27
79,It's like has Ozark been canceled?,34
80,"And I'm like, fuck, they canceled that show?",44
81,That show's amazing.,20
82,So then I click on the article.,31
83,The entire article is about a guy who couldn't find season one on Ozark because there was a glitch and then he found it.,120
84,And so it's not.,16
85,So the whole article was just bullshit.,39
86,But they got me.,16
87,They get everybody.,19
88,They got you to click.,22
89,They got their advertising dollars because they can show the engagement with the audience.,90
90,Exactly.,8
91,"Well, here's a good one.",24
92,CNN showed a guy got shot yesterday in San Bernardino.,54
93,Hispanic man got shot in San Bernardino.,40
94,So that's the title.,20
95,The title of the article is Hispanic man gets gunned down by the police in San Bernardino.,90
96,What they leave out is the guy had a gun and was shooting at the cops.,70
97,So this guy's got a gun.,24
98,There's photos of this gentleman with a gun.,44
99,And there's a cop on his knees about to shoot the guy standing in front of a gas station.,89
100,There's gas pumps.,18
101,"I mean, I mean, maybe he felt like they wouldn't shoot at him because the gas tanks were right behind him.",106
102,The pumps were right behind him.,32
103,But why would they leave that out?,34
104,Guy with gun in gun fight with cops dies is the right title.,60
105,Not Hispanic man gunned down by cops.,37
106,They're literally trying to incite anger and violence.,54
107,They know that you read that and you say Hispanic man shot by cops like these motherfuckers.,92
108,They're murderers.,18
109,They won't stop.,16
110,And they leave out this picture of this man with a gun pointing it.,67
111,You're looking at me like I'm going to say some kind of really profound answer.,79
112,I got nothing for you because because you're exactly right.,59
113,What is it?,11
114,What did they set up that headline for?,39
115,It's an outrage people.,23
116,"Anyone that actually opens it up in regions would actually probably say something like, hmm, it feels like the cops did a good job on that one and killed a bad guy before he blew up a gas station and he killed a bunch of innocent people.",237
117,But that's obviously not the thing.,35
118,"I mean, think of you trying to write a headline the other way of how these heroic cops face man with gun eliminate him before he can cause terror in this neighborhood.",167
119,"That would be a nice headline to read, but you're not going to see it.",70
120,You're not going to do that.,28
121,Not today.,10
122,Because it's not going to drive enough people crazy.,52
123,"Today, if your wife tweets all lives matter, you can get fired.",63
124,"You just, you just need to be you anymore.",42
125,Yeah.,5
126,Yeah.,5
127,All lives matter.,17
128,Just imagine a time we're saying all lives matter is so controversial that you can get fired.,93
129,Didn't that happen to a soccer player or something?,51
130,Yes.,4
131,A soccer player's wife tweeted something like that.,51
132,Yeah.,5
133,"The guy who runs the Kings or the guy who's the commentator for the Kings, they fired him.",90
134,"You know, and then this is a lot of it is this, right?",54
135,"So people are feeling a certain way and they're not, they're not feel like this girl that wrote all lives matter.",113
136,Do you think that was her clandestine way of showing that she's all about white pride?,86
137,You know what I mean?,21
138,No.,3
139,"She was thinking, hey, everyone matters.",40
140,She's probably having some nice thoughts.,41
141,"You know, she's, but then all of a sudden, no, this chick is evil, right?",73
142,They're doing this.,19
143,And I think there's a lot of that.,34
144,I think there's a lot of people that I think most people are pretty sane.,73
145,I think most people are pretty reasonable.,42
146,"I think, you know, anybody looking at the George Floyd case is like, yeah, that's completely wrong.",99
147,That's disgusting.,18
148,It's horrible.,14
149,Tain is to watch.,17
150,I haven't heard anyone say anything other than that.,52
151,"So how are we just getting so completely divided on this whole thing and start attacking people, start attacking each other?",124
152,"It's over, over absolutely everything.",38
153,That's a good point because this is literally a case where no one is saying there's nothing wrong with that cop did.,116
154,No one.,7
155,No one.,7
156,Zero people.,12
157,Zero people.,12
158,"But yet, everybody still at each other's throats.",49
159,"Zero people have, have stuck up that guy in any way, shape or form.",67
160,"Even law enforcement, no law enforcement people saying you got to understand this is how you control a man.",107
161,"You got a lien on his neck for about eight minutes, 40, 45 seconds, 46 seconds.",79
162,No one saying that.,19
163,"And unfortunately, what you know what they're saying?",53
164,"They're saying, defund the police.",34
165,"They're saying no more chokeholds, right?",41
166,Which is crazy.,15
167,It's crazy.,11
168,Yeah.,5
169,"If you want to get someone to be under control and you can't choke them, you know what you have to do?",102
170,You have to hit them in the head with a baton.,46
171,Yeah.,5
172,Seven times.,12
173,"You got a risk given them brain damage, permanently injuring them.",66
174,"If people know what they're doing, I mean, obviously, if people know what they're doing, we'll put a chokehold.",111
175,They'll wake up.,16
176,They'll be cuffed.,18
177,We're all good.,15
178,"Yeah, obviously.",16
179,"But, you know, it's the people that are doing it wrong is the problem.",70
180,"The people that shouldn't be doing it in the first place, it's untrained people.",80
181,"But if you're a cop and you're a fight for your life and you can't use chokeholds, it's fucking crazy.",102
182,It's insane.,12
183,You're going to get shot and killed or somebody else is going to get shot and killed.,85
184,Someone's going to take your gun.,33
185,Yeah.,5
186,"And the idea of defund the police and I understand the premise, okay?",69
187,"And this is once again where many people that say defund the police, they don't mean, hey, just get rid of the police.",118
188,"Of course, there's a fraction of people that are saying defund the police means we don't want any more police anymore.",118
189,There's a portion of people saying that.,40
190,"There's some people that are saying, well, if we defund the police, we can relocate some of that money and we can do better schools and we can put money into the infrastructure inside these neighborhoods.",204
191,But here's the problem.,23
192,You know what the police need more than anything else?,54
193,They need money for training.,29
194,"And the way the police departments are set up, they do the most ridiculously minuscule amount of training for what their job is.",128
195,"So as you know, I was in the SEAL teams, we would train for 18 months, 18 months, we would train to go on a six month deployment.",129
196,"Cops, they train, they get like two hours or four hours of combative training, a year, a year.",94
197,That's complete insanity.,25
198,It's complete insanity.,23
199,"The thing I've been saying is, cops should train one fifth of the time.",71
200,"One fifth of the time, you should be training whether it's two hours a day, four times a week or whether it's one day a week where you're going to go and you're going to go through scenarios.",191
201,You're going to do combatives.,30
202,You're going to work with Simunition.,37
203,You're going to do de-escalation drills because it's really hard.,65
204,"I mean, being a cop is, I think, the hardest job in the world.",62
205,"And by the way, they're not going to have to worry about defunding the police because no one's going to want to be a cop anymore.",129
206,Who is going to be fired up to be a cop right now?,50
207,"Who's going to think, you know what?",36
208,"When I grow up, I want to be hated by a massive portion of the country.",71
209,I want to be viewed as someone that kills innocent people.,58
210,The recruiting in cop for police is going to go down so hard.,61
211,It's going to be ridiculous.,28
212,It's going to be ridiculous.,28
213,And then who are you getting there?,35
214,You're going to get people that are worse level people.,55
215,Worse level humans are going to show up to be cops.,51
216,"So the training piece though, they should do very, very scenario driven training, right?",88
217,Where you come into a room and this isn't like super expensive stuff either.,76
218,You come into a room.,21
219,There's a person there.,23
220,They appear to be compliant.,28
221,"You ask, you learn how to talk to them.",39
222,"You very quickly learn that instead of yelling them out of the gate, you say, hey, man, what's going on?",104
223,"Hey, what's your name?",22
224,"You know, what's going on?",26
225,We got a call here is everything okay.,38
226,You immediately de-escalate.,28
227,"Then you learn what to do when they're not, when they don't respond the way you want them to respond.",101
228,Then you learn what to do when they start to do something drastic.,66
229,What's the best thing for you?,30
230,And you play through these scenarios.,37
231,It's just like Jiu-Jitsu.,25
232,"In the fact that what makes Jiu-Jitsu good, what makes Jiu-Jitsu good is we can go hard against each other over and over again and not really get hurt, not really get killed.",174
233,So you get really good at it.,29
234,That's what you need to do in training for police.,50
235,You need to go through these tough scenarios over and over again because you do get better at it.,97
236,You do get better at it.,24
237,"You become, you learn how to mentally detach and not get emotional and realize that there's other things that are happening.",124
238,"When you see the George Floyd case, a couple of the other cops too.",67
239,"I think two of the other guys were complete rookies, right?",59
240,They'd been on the force for a very short period of time.,57
241,No one in that group before.,28
242,"Obviously, you got the killer himself.",38
243,He's actually conducting the act.,33
244,But all the other guys are not paying attention.,48
245,They're all emotional themselves.,33
246,"Hey, stay back.",15
247,"And they're probably watching him say, what's the, why is that guy moving?",74
248,And they're just caught up in it.,33
249,"Whereas if someone were to show it up on the scene or one of those guys had been through some good training in their life, they would have said, what's happening here?",167
250,Hold on.,8
251,My partner over there has been on this guy for two minutes.,59
252,He's not moving anymore.,24
253,"I'm going to walk over and say, hey, man, let me take over.",59
254,I got this.,11
255,Go over there.,14
256,Decompress.,11
257,This takes training.,20
258,You have to train people.,25
259,"And I got, I saw this over and over again in the SEAL teams training guys.",74
260,"You get a young kid that's coming through training for the first time and they go into a room and they're getting shot with Simu Nishin bullets or they're someone yelling and screaming or they, we put, we put Arabic women coming, walking out of rooms.",251
261,We'd have people get blown up with wounds.,42
262,We would do this to them over and over again.,45
263,"So they realized, okay, I just got to relax.",44
264,I got to take a step back.,26
265,"I got to detach from this situation so I can process what's happening and I can make a good decision because as I said earlier, no one is making a good decision when they're panicked, when they're freaked out, when they're scared.",230
266,"As a Jiu Jitsu guy, when someone puts hands on you, you're not actually scared, right?",86
267,"You're like, oh, okay, I know what to do here.",46
268,"If you don't know Jiu Jitsu, if you've never had someone grab you before or you haven't had someone grab you in 17 months or 14 months, no one's laid hands on you because you've got a badge and a gun.",200
269,"So people, when you tell them to do something, 95% of time, they go, okay, I don't want to get in trouble, but then somebody grabs you.",135
270,"You're instantly, your emotions are spiked, you're adrenaline spiked and the only way to overcome that is through consistent training that happens on a regular basis.",166
271,You can't just train somebody one time.,39
272,It's like ring rust.,20
273,"You can't just train somebody one time and, oh, now I don't need a training anymore.",84
274,"No, you need to do continuous training.",39
275,"So that fact right there, if we want to help the police through these situations, we need to invest more money into them.",121
276,We need to get them better training.,36
277,We need to pull them out of the field to train and pull them out of the field to decompress because you ever done a ride along?,127
278,No.,3
279,"Whether you're doing a ride along, whether you're going into any situation where you're thinking you could be killed and even if it's just a remote chance, but you're doing that all the time, all the time and you're here and you're seeing on the news, you're, oh, you're here.",276
280,"Your buddy got shot, your buddy got whatever.",45
281,"This other guy got, you know, taken his gun, taken away.",56
282,Like that stuff happens.,24
283,That stuff happens.,19
284,People get killed.,18
285,"I mean, there's been, I think there's been 31 cops killed this year, 31 cops killed this year.",94
286,"And a lot of those, that's not including, you know, like a car accident or COVID, there's been a bunch of either COVID, but just people that have been engaged with bad guys and they got killed.",193
287,So you're a cop.,16
288,"When another cop gets killed, you're thinking that could be you.",64
289,So that's your mindset and that mindset builds and that mindset builds and you're working 10 hour days and you're working 12 hour days and there's no training and there's no breaks.,181
290,Where do you end up?,20
291,Right?,6
292,You end up being a little bit paranoid.,39
293,You end up being a little bit angry.,36
294,What happens when you get in a fight with your wife?,52
295,"You know, it's like all these things, you add them together.",60
296,"It's a freaking hard job and from a, from a, like an entire systemic way of training and recruiting and, and keeping police ready to do their job, whatever that job entails.",173
297,"Because let's face it, most of the time that in job entails, well, I guess most of the time it entails, hey, I'm going to go have a bad, I'm about to go have a bad relationship with another human being.",202
298,"That's what's about to happen, right?",37
299,"Whether I'm pulling you over, whether I'm, I've been called to your house because you were yelling and screaming and people heard your wife screaming or whatever, that's what's happening.",187
300,I'm showing up in a bad relationship.,37
301,You don't like me and I already don't like you.,47
302,That's where we start.,22
303,That's where we start.,22
304,So we got to train people for that.,35
305,"We also got to train them for all the times that they go into, help people, save people.",88
306,"The first people on the scene at Car Accents, people are bleeding out.",70
307,We got to train them for that.,30
308,"And then they have to also be trained for, hey, this is a bad guy that's going to, this is the guy that you just talked about at a gas station with a weapon that wants to kill a bunch of people.",194
309,You got to be prepared for that whole spectrum as a police officer.,67
310,And yet we send them to a three month long police academy and then we send them out in the street.,98
311,And that's what they do.,24
312,"Day in, day out, day in, day out.",33
313,It seems to me that they need to be vetted too.,47
314,Much better than they are now.,30
315,Just like the seals.,20
316,Like you can't get through buds unless you are a superior human being.,70
317,You have to be able to tolerate a bunch of shit that most people are going to fall apart during.,96
318,"And this is, this seems to me that there's a great way to weed out people that just don't have it.",98
319,"Yeah, there's, well, one thing that's interesting, just from a physical perspective, most police departments don't even have a minimum physical requirement to continue to be on the force.",187
320,"You have to be at a certain level to graduate from the academies, but oftentimes there's no standard beyond that.",113
321,"Yeah, I've seen cops before that we're like, this is hilarious.",63
322,Like what is going to stop someone from closing the distance on you?,68
323,"Like you, you're again to that gun.",35
324,Yep.,4
325,But the mental aspect is stuff that you can get better at.,58
326,"You can get better at it, but you only get better at it through training.",73
327,And you only get really comfortable through training a lot.,59
328,And yet we put these people in these horrible positions over and over and over again.,85
329,"And we get, we don't give them the proper training.",51
330,"And now there's these politicians that because of the current social climate, they're encouraged to want to defund the police.",126
331,That's a great way for them to get brownie points from their constituents.,74
332,"The people want the police to fund it, which is the dumbest idea I've ever heard of my life.",92
333,It's so crazy that this is actually gaining steam to the point where it in Minneapolis because they're trying to quiet down the mob.,132
334,They've actually gone ahead and done it.,40
335,What the fuck is Minneapolis going to look like in a year from now?,67
336,It's going to look like Mad Max.,32
337,"I mean, it's going to be crazy.",31
338,That's going to be crazy.,25
339,"It's going to be, you know, criminals will go there to commit crimes.",69
340,"If there's no, if there's no police there, are you crazy?",57
341,"By the way, it's Jocco Energy Drink is the shit.",48
342,That's very legit.,18
343,Right.,6
344,I don't understand where they think this game ends.,51
345,I don't think they've planned it out.,37
346,They're not playing chess.,26
347,The other thing that you're talking about this brownie points for the politicians and there's brownie points and there's people trying to create sides.,151
348,It's my side versus your side.,30
349,"And that's a completely political thing, right?",47
350,And all that does is increase the divide between the police and the civilians.,78
351,"And this reminds me a lot of a counterinsurgency, right?",56
352,"So counterinsurgency, the insurgents are bad guys inside of a country.",70
353,The country's not bad.,22
354,There's some bad guys in a country.,35
355,So what you have to do is you actually have to go out and build relationships with the good people inside that country so that the good people inside that country can help you get rid of the bad people.,202
356,"What happens if you go out and so this is Ramadi Iraq, my last deployment to Iraq, there's a bunch of just totally normal good people, Iraqi people that are living in the city of Ramadi.",186
357,What do they want to do?,24
358,You know what they want to do?,30
359,They want to send their kids to school.,39
360,They want to run their little market.,37
361,"They want to do whatever they do, that's what they want to do.",62
362,They have the same goal as a normal family.,43
363,They're just a normal bunch of people.,38
364,"And inside that group of people, there's a bunch of bad people.",63
365,And these are insurgents.,25
366,Some of them are foreign fighters.,34
367,"Some of them are foreign regime elements from Saddam, but they're bad.",70
368,And they want to create chaos and mayhem.,41
369,"So Americans, we go in there.",29
370,"If we go in there, super heavy handed.",38
371,"And while I go to capture or kill one bad guy, I kill or name a couple of those normal civilians.",97
372,What happens?,13
373,"Well, a couple of those normal civilians family go, wait, you guys aren't good.",79
374,You guys are bad.,17
375,You guys just killed my brother and he didn't do anything wrong.,64
376,And then we do it again.,24
377,And then we do it again.,24
378,And then we do it again.,24
379,"And each time that we do this, we're creating more animosity from the local populace, who by the way, like I said, they're just good normal people.",147
380,So what we had to do is really focus on going out and building relationships with the local populace.,101
381,How do we do that?,18
382,"And one of the things, this happened after I left, but you remember the surge that took plays and they sent a bunch more troops over there?",139
383,Part of the reason that they sent that surge and part of the reason that that was allowed to happen was because the battle of Ramadi where I fought went very well.,163
384,"And since it went well, people said, well, maybe we can pull this off.",70
385,So they sent more troops.,25
386,And one of the directives that General Petreus gave is he said there can be no more drive-by counterinsurgency.,111
387,"And what he meant by that was when you go to a neighborhood, you can't just drive through the neighborhood in your home, the bulletproof home, with your windows up, drive through, show a force, and then leave.",209
388,That doesn't work.,18
389,What you have to do is stop your vehicles.,42
390,You have to get out.,20
391,You have to talk to the local populace.,39
392,You have to ask them what's going on.,37
393,You have to ask them if they need anything.,43
394,"You have to build relationships with the local populace, the good local populace that just wants those insurgents out of there.",127
395,And that's what I don't see happening.,38
396,"And the more we increase this divide between the police and the civilians, the worse that's going to get.",105
397,"And so the police have to start doing a better job of outreach of, hey, you know, I asked you if you did a ride along.",118
398,"They should be offering ride longs all the time till the local kids, 17 year old kids, 15 year old kids.",104
399,"Hey, come and see what my job is like.",38
400,Come and help me out.,21
401,"That 15 year old kid, he knows who the bad actors are.",54
402,He knows who the good kids are.,31
403,"You know, bring that kid along on a ride along.",47
404,Let him see what it looks like from your ankle.,47
405,"Get out, meet the parents, meet the families.",45
406,That's where we're failing to build relationships between the police and the civilians.,87
407,And that causes these problems.,31
408,"I think you're 100% correct, but I don't hear anybody repeating what you're saying.",83
409,That's what's terrifying to me.,31
410,I think everything you're saying is logical.,44
411,It makes sense.,15
412,It comes from experience.,25
413,I don't hear anybody saying this.,33
414,Yeah.,5
415,"And I, well, I think maybe it's because people just don't recognize what's happening because they're too in it, right?",118
416,They're too in it.,18
417,They're wrapped up in it.,25
418,And that's another part.,24
419,"You know, I talked about recruiting.",36
420,Who are you recruiting?,23
421,"Those kids recruit those kids, but you have to build a relationship with them before you can add before anyone's going to go into the police.",141
422,"And look, I think it's the LA police department.",48
423,"If you look at the LA police department, compared to the racial makeup of LA, they, they're pretty equivalent.",110
424,And they're pretty equivalent on purpose.,41
425,They do that for a reason.,26
426,So you got to get that.,23
427,You got to continue to build that those relationships so that we talk to one another.,85
428,"You know, we actually communicate with each other because any time, you know, I'm allowed to sit over here in my area and you're sitting over there in your area.",161
429,We're building animosity.,25
430,We build that kind of animosity between each other.,51
431,"And now the littlest thing, the littlest thing.",47
432,"I mean, there was a woman that was killed in Minneapolis two, three years ago.",78
433,Do you remember this one?,25
434,Yes.,4
435,Female.,7
436,"A yoga instructor called the police, called the police to report a disturbance.",79
437,"We showed up and there's no video, no footage.",46
438,She gets killed by the cops.,28
439,She gets killed by the cops.,28
440,It's insane that these things happen.,37
441,"But we also have to remember what, like I said, what is a police officer thinking about?",88
442,And what kind of training and we give them?,43
443,And what kind of psychological screening to your point?,55
444,What kind of strike?,20
445,And it's not just one time psychological screening because guess what?,70
446,We'll get burnt out and it happens at different times to different people.,74
447,You take 35 guys in combat.,27
448,I've got some guys at the end of a six month deployment there.,62
449,You know what they're telling me?,33
450,Can I stay longer?,18
451,I'm doing fine.,15
452,You get one month under that deployment.,40
453,"You've got other guys that are saying, hey, do you need anyone to head home early?",82
454,Right?,6
455,That happens.,13
456,"So you think in a police force of a thousand people or whatever size your police force is, you're going to have some people that are steady, mentally stable.",157
457,They can deal with it.,22
458,They can go.,12
459,They can be in an officer-involved shooting today.,50
460,And tomorrow they can go back to their job and be perfectly fine.,65
461,There's other people they can never work again after they're in an officer-involved shooting.,93
462,What kind of investment are we making into this psychological health of police?,79
463,"And look, I hope it doesn't sound like I'm sitting here just putting it all on the police because everyone is playing a role in this.",133
464,And one of the things that you need to look at as well is how to get arrested.,78
465,Right?,6
466,There should be a public service course on how you should get arrested.,71
467,This is what you should do.,27
468,If the cops are pulling you over.,33
469,"If the cops ask you, if the cops approach you about something, here's what you should think.",92
470,"One of the things you should think is, okay, this cop may not be bad.",69
471,This cop may be looking out for my welfare right now.,53
472,That's a great hopeful thought.,31
473,The other thing that you have to think is kind of worst-case scenario.,70
474,This cop might be agitated.,27
475,This cop might be looking for somebody that fits my description.,64
476,This cop might have just been in a fight with his wife.,55
477,He might have just lost a part of it.,37
478,There's a million bad things.,29
479,Use that scenario in your head.,31
480,Use that scenario in your head to contemplate how you're going to interact with a police officer.,97
481,"Which is, you know what they're looking at?",43
482,They're looking at your hands.,30
483,You know why?,13
484,Because that's where the threat comes from.,43
485,The threat comes from your hands.,33
486,"So when you're making quick movement with your hands, don't do that.",68
487,Listen to what they say.,24
488,Move slowly when you move.,26
489,This should be public service.,30
490,"The police should be putting out, hey, if you interact with the police, we hate to have to say this.",100
491,"But since our police sometimes are in bad situations, here's some things we recommend and we highly suggest and we beg.",119
492,We beg that you do this.,24
493,We beg because what happens to these cops when they kill somebody?,66
494,What happens to them?,21
495,Their lives are totally destroyed.,34
496,"Well, that was the thing about that guy in Minneapolis.",55
497,He'd already killed people.,27
498,He'd already been involved and I think it's at least two shootings and he had more than a dozen complaints against him.,119
499,Yeah.,5
500,Not good.,9
501,Not good.,9
502,"I mean, it's obvious by the end by the end result.",50
503,That's the type of guy he was.,30
504,It's pretty obvious by the fact that he was able to do that to a man.,69
505,The guy's literally calling out to his dead mother.,51
506,"You know, I mean, the type of man that can stay on someone's neck while they're doing that when all that guy did was have a counterfeit $20 bill.",145
507,That's it.,10
508,"This is where when you talk about psychological screening and that's why I'm saying it has to be constant because people, people change, right?",143
509,And red flags.,14
510,"I mean, like you said, hindsight's 2020, we're looking at this case.",68
511,"Now we're going, oh, who the hell lets this guy continue to police?",67
512,"And by the way, interestingly enough, if you talk to internal affairs at police departments, the vast majority of the complaints that they get about other about police are from police.",184
513,"So they come, they report each other.",37
514,That's little known fact.,25
515,"Most of the most of the reports don't come from the civilians out there saying, hey, this happened or that happened.",116
516,"Most of the time it's cops saying, hey, this guy was out of line here.",70
517,"Well, that's, that's a good sign.",33
518,"This, it just, it doesn't look rosy when I'm looking at the future.",67
519,"I don't, I don't see a way during this climate.",47
520,"Well, what scares me the most is I don't see a way if we don't talk to each other.",82
521,That's where there's no solution.,33
522,"Because you know, look, for every 10 viral video that you see of a, of a cop hitting somebody with a baton or a ride or throwing something through a window for every 10 of those viral videos, there's another viral video that has, you know, the guy with the free hugs t-shirt on that's out talking to the cops and saying, hey, you know, I get it and they're communicating with each other and talking.",399
523,"And when you communicate with, it's, it's just like a hostage rescue basic technique.",85
524,You want to humanize.,21
525,You want to humanize instead of dehumanize.,43
526,And right now we're just dehumanizing each other completely.,60
527,And that's what scares me more than anything else is if we can't talk to each other.,84
528,"Because look, you take the most hardened soldier in war, some, you know, some badass soldier that's done four deployments, six deployments, whatever.",149
529,"And you put him into a room with a kid in a mom, an Iraqi kid in a mom or an Afghan kid in a mom.",97
530,"And you put him in that room and say, hey, sit here for 15 minutes and find out what they're about.",99
531,Here's an interpreter.,22
532,"That guy's going to come out of there going, yeah, I get where they're coming from.",83
533,And same thing vice versa.,26
534,"You take a hardened jihadist and you say, hey, talk to this guy over here about what he's trying to do inside your country.",123
535,"Well, just, just talk to him.",29
536,When you open up the communications and are you going to get some extremists on both ends?,90
537,"Yes, you will.",14
538,"So maybe I shouldn't have said the most hardened soldier in the most hardened, because that, you know, what the most hardened soldier becomes a killer, becomes a killer.",169
539,That happens.,13
540,Happens all the time.,21
541,"You know, I, I shouldn't say it happens all time.",49
542,It happens from time to time.,29
543,"That's how you get the me, lie, massacre.",41
544,It happens.,11
545,"The, the most hardened jihadist, they're not going to change their mind.",72
546,"They're not going to come to any, any rose colored view of America.",67
547,"But barring those total extremes, you've got people.",52
548,"You got you, other human beings.",32
549,"And if you can get them to talk to each other, they can find consensus.",71
550,They can find common ground.,28
551,"But if they're not talking to each other, then we don't move it, make any progress.",83
552,"And what, to your whole kind of point about what's happening right now, there's less and less communication between people, open communication.",143
553,"Because if you, if you talk to someone and they say, the cops did this, this and this.",86
554,"And you say, oh, okay, explain to me what happened.",51
555,Tell me what went down.,23
556,"And then you say, hey, let me tell you what it's like for, for a cop being a cop when he sees that, when he sees something going on.",132
557,How many domestic violence cases happened and the person shows up and they're getting assaulted by both parties.,112
558,"So maybe that's what you're this comp was thinking when he showed up and saw your mom in this situation and did this to your dad, right?",136
559,"Like this is real conversations, but we don't, we don't have them.",66
560,"And not only we don't have them, it seems like it seems like there's forces that are actively trying to prevent us from talking to each other, from sitting down at a table and saying, hey, man, what, tell me what's going on?",224
561,What forces?,12
562,"Who wants, who wants the country to be divided?",47
563,"It's the people that you're talking about earlier that, that, how do they score points?",87
564,How do I score points with this group?,38
565,How do I score points with the other group?,43
566,"It's by making, making everything as divisive as possible.",58
567,"It's, it's, it's horrible to watch, man.",40
568,It's sickening to watch.,24
569,"I was reading a whole series of tweets where there's a journalist that was talking about how cops shooting black men is a real problem, but another real problem that's not being discussed by this black lives matter group is black on black crime.",245
570,And how do we stop all the murders that are taking place in Chicago?,68
571,And this is something that should be discussed.,47
572,And this guy was getting attacked.,34
573,"And one of the, another journalist is literally tweeting at him saying, you have been told not to discuss this.",111
574,"But yet he ignores the, these commands that, that he should not discuss is a very real issue.",93
575,"The, as if somehow or another bringing up another issue that is also a problem diminishes the original issue of this guy getting killed by cops, which, of course, it doesn't.",174
576,Yeah.,5
577,"But this, the idea is that there's problems, there's real problems.",67
578,It's not just the cops killing these people.,44
579,"There's, there's, look, the cop killed this guy in Minneapolis.",63
580,He didn't do anything in Seattle.,33
581,How the fuck did that shit happen in Seattle?,45
582,"Well, it happened in Seattle because of this reactionary world where, where one person does something somewhere, it gets through social media, it gets through the mainstream media.",180
583,"It becomes this, this huge inflammatory subject.",48
584,"And then the next thing you know, windows are getting smashed, things are getting lit on fire, cars are getting turned over, blocks are getting taken.",150
585,And that's what we find ourselves.,34
586,I think it was May 29.,22
587,There was a cop killed.,23
588,"I want to say in Texas, and he was killed when they rolled into a scene.",72
589,"They got, they got a call, hey, suspicious person running through the neighborhood.",83
590,They roll up on the scene.,26
591,"They start a couple, a few cops are now searching for this guy and they see a building with an open door.",105
592,"They go, okay, let's, that maybe he's in there.",47
593,Let's go clear this building with an open door.,47
594,They go in this building with an open door.,43
595,There's shots fired.,20
596,One of the cops killed one of the other cops.,45
597,"So, so, so just, you know, friendly fire, death.",48
598,"That right there, if you, if you take that and you just extrapolate that over how hard it is to be a police officer, that you can be going into a building and you shoot one of your friends because you think they're bad.",219
599,That is a real problem.,23
600,That's how hard this job is.,28
601,"My point is that's how hard this job is, but we have to do a better job of explaining that.",91
602,We have to do a better job of explaining how hard this job is.,62
603,"As far as the, hey, don't talk about black on black violence.",61
604,"I was trying to, I was talking with my podcast, bro, Echo Charles, who's a black guy.",85
605,"And we were talking about that and I said, you know, I think it might have a little bit to do with this.",104
606,"If you were, if you're watching UFC and there's two guys that are fighting and the round ends, like just, just at the end of the round, all of a sudden the referee comes in and like punches one of the, like, like just, just, just, more tight kicks a guy in the head and knocks him out.",285
607,"Everyone would be completely, utterly outraged about this, right?",65
608,Because that guy wasn't in the game.,36
609,"What the, what's that guy doing?",32
610,So I think there's a little bit of that.,40
611,"That's the, the referee is supposed to not do that.",51
612,"And when you see a cop, the thought is, hey, that guy's like, that guy's viewed as a referee.",93
613,That guy's not supposed to be doing this.,41
614,"So I think that is kind of where some of that, that, that outrage comes from because this is a cop.",99
615,This isn't supposed to be happening here.,41
616,"This guy is no, not supposed to be killing people.",50
617,And he did.,11
618,That's also that the cop is just a person who has this extraordinary power.,75
619,Yes.,4
620,And extraordinary responsibility too.,37
621,"What's terrifying to me is that what, what, what I'm looking at this idea to defund the police and then I'm thinking, like, what are these, what are these neighborhoods look like if you wind up doing that?",205
622,And then how do you get back out of that?,41
623,What do you do?,15
624,Refund the police?,18
625,Do you ramp it up and do it better next time?,45
626,"I mean, this is a long process.",31
627,"You're looking at a lot of trial and error here over, you know, perhaps multiple years before they figure out what, what they fucked up.",136
628,Yeah.,5
629,"And I know there's some, there's some city.",43
630,I think it's in New Jersey.,27
631,That.,5
632,Camden.,7
633,Yes.,4
634,"That completely disband, dismantled their police.",49
635,But then they rebuilt a new police department.,46
636,And I actually get that.,24
637,Like you could get a department that was so completely and utterly corrupt.,75
638,Yeah.,5
639,You know what?,14
640,We're getting rid of all of them.,33
641,Did you ever see cocaine cowboys?,33
642,No.,3
643,Great documentary.,18
644,"But one of the things it talks about is the corruption during the cocaine era of the 80s where the entire graduating police force, the entire, from the police academy, the entire graduating year, everyone was either murdered or went to jail for corruption.",256
645,"Everyone, the entire graduating class.",38
646,That's how bad it was.,22
647,"So if you have that kind of, that kind of problem, I get it.",60
648,You might want to dismantle that police force.,46
649,You know what happens in the SEAL team sometimes.,49
650,"Sometimes there's a platoon that's so bad that they just, they just dismantled the whole platoon.",97
651,How often does that?,20
652,Very rarely.,12
653,But it does happen.,19
654,Really?,7
655,Yeah.,5
656,What causes something like that?,32
657,"Usually there, well, the problem is bad leadership.",51
658,"It's always bad leadership because you can take a bunch of knuckleheads and you give them a good leader and they'll do, they'll do fine.",136
659,So it's always comes down to the leadership.,44
660,So sometimes they'll replace a leader.,38
661,"But if the, and usually when they replace a leader, you'll watch the platoon will turn around almost instantly because someone steps in and says, all right, here's what we're doing.",181
662,Here's how we're doing it.,26
663,And they make that change.,26
664,"But sometimes you have just like a bad platoon and they say, you know what?",75
665,You guys are done.,18
666,It seems incredibly difficult to be a good leader.,50
667,"One of the more interesting things about what you're doing with your platform, whether it's your podcast or the Instagram videos that you put out, you're showing what good leadership is.",186
668,"There's not a lot of people when you look at it, if you get a thousand people, how many of those people are going to be a real good leader?",139
669,"Well, this is what's, this is what has become my career after the SEAL teams because I got very, very lucky in the SEAL teams.",126
670,"Very, very lucky.",17
671,"First of all, my whole career was just luck.",44
672,I was the luckiest guy ever in the SEAL teams.,46
673,And I happened to be in the right places at the right times and I got some great experience in some very tough situations.,122
674,"And then the last thing that I did in the SEAL teams for almost the last three years I was in was I ran the training, the tactical training, not the training where guys carry boats on their head and carry logs around.",217
675,But I didn't do that.,21
676,"I didn't, I went through it, but I didn't run that training.",60
677,"I ran the training where everything I was talking about, you're running scenarios, you're putting people in bad situations, you're using sim unition, you're doing all these things.",180
678,"So I got to see over and over again, leaders get put into pressure situations and how their leaders responded and then how the team responds to that leader and what these different things wash out, how they wash out and what's interesting is and what I really realized when I was in that position is that their leadership is a skill.",333
679,And you can get better at it.,29
680,"Now just like fighting, just like Jiu Jitsu, there's certain people that have a natural propensity to be good at.",113
681,"You got some, let's say someone's really strong, right?",55
682,They're going to have an advantage.,35
683,Let's say someone's super flexible.,35
684,They're going to have a little advantage.,41
685,"Let's say someone has, they're big, right?",42
686,"These things are advantages in fighting and leadership, it's the same thing.",76
687,Let's say someone is super articulate.,38
688,That's helpful.,15
689,Let's say someone doesn't have a bad temper.,44
690,"That's very helpful, but everyone is at a different level.",58
691,"Well just like you can take a bunch of different sized and shaped and athletic ability people and you can make them better at fighting, you can take a bunch of people with different levels of leadership characteristics and you can improve them.",244
692,And then there are actual moves.,32
693,There's actual moves that you can do as a leader that are just like a Jiu Jitsu move.,85
694,"Oh, Joe comes to me and he's yelling and screaming at me that he didn't get the, I didn't give him two extra people to go on his job.",133
695,"Instead of me going, hey, Joe, shut up.",39
696,You don't know what you're talking about.,41
697,"Instead of actually listening to you, right?",44
698,"I listen to you say, well, hold on, I didn't know you needed that many people.",78
699,What do you need them for?,26
700,So I show a little sense of urgency.,36
701,I kind of reflect what your emotions are.,41
702,"So I'm not just creating a fight between you and me because if you and I are fighting, you and I are not finding a solution.",124
703,So I'm going to reflect a little bit of your emotion and then I'm going to diminish it a little bit so you and I can have a real conversation.,142
704,"So there's moves that you can do as a leader that function like a Jiu Jitsu move and they're very, very powerful.",113
705,"The more of them you learn, the better off you'll be.",53
706,And you need to practice them.,30
707,You won't be good out of the gate.,34
708,"It's going to take some, just like if I showed you in our mock and you never done Jiu Jitsu before, you're not going to be able to just get on the mat and do it to somebody.",173
709,You're going to have to try it a couple times.,46
710,You're going to have to learn the little nuances to the move.,61
711,So there are ways that leaders can get better.,46
712,"But yes, there's absolutely natural leadership qualities that make people just a natural, better leader.",104
713,But even those people can improve.,34
714,"So your question of out of a thousand people, how many really good leaders there are, well, you have to ask, okay, you just talk about how many people are just naturally born great leaders.",189
715,You're probably your suspicion is correct.,42
716,It's not a huge amount.,23
717,But how many of those leaders can you improve exponentially in their ability to lead?,85
718,"That's what, you don't have a company that's on front.",54
719,That's what we do all the time is we go and work with companies.,64
720,We work with leaders.,21
721,That is exactly what we do.,27
722,"And we take companies of, I mean, we work with companies that have 150,000 employees and you start getting everyone all the leaders aligned and getting the frontline troops, understanding where the, where the leadership is and what they're thinking.",249
723,"So you can become a much, much better leader over time.",55
724,Now how much of this do we see in the civilian sector?,54
725,"How much do even more directly, how much of this do we see in the political world?",82
726,"The answer is, unbelievably small amount.",41
727,"I mean, it's a ridiculously small amount.",41
728,It's a ridiculously small amount.,33
729,Why is that?,12
730,I bet there's a lot of reasons.,31
731,"First of all, who, who at this point in the world thinks that that sounds like a great job, right?",98
732,"Hey, I'm going to go get attacked from all sides.",49
733,I'm going to have my personal life picked apart.,48
734,"I'm going to get, you know, make, I'm going to work really hard and really not, I'm going to have a pay cap on how much money I make.",133
735,"There's all kinds of reasons why becoming a politician doesn't look like the best job for most people that would look and say, hey, would I rather be the CEO of a company and make it to a money and make, create a huge product and leave a big impact and influence thousands of people that work on my company in a positive way or would I rather go and get ridiculed and get broke down and have to try and get my job a kid in four years or two years or whatever the case may be.",475
736,"It's a tough, that's a tough job too.",37
737,"And a lot of people say, I'm not going to, why would I jump into that game?",75
738,"Well, I know I say that, why would I jump into that game?",57
739,Why would I want to go and be a politician right now?,53
740,Right?,6
741,It's crazy.,11
742,"Like for me to, for me to want to go into the, into the political world, there would have to be complete nutter chaos in America.",129
743,"I mean, way beyond, beyond where we're at.",42
744,Are you thought about this?,27
745,Yeah.,5
746,"I'm telling you what I think when, because people ask me, oh, you should do this, you should do that.",101
747,"I say, um, you know, we're not at a point where we need this to kind of, we might be about four days away from it.",114
748,We could be.,12
749,"I think the answer, you know, let's get, let's get out, Dwayne the Rock Johnson.",80
750,I agree with you.,17
751,"He's, he's the guy that could really, I think, unify people and I think he would have to run as an independent and I recommend he does it right now.",148
752,Right now.,10
753,"He's like, yeah, you know what?",31
754,I'm in.,7
755,I'm in.,7
756,I think he would win.,21
757,I think he would win.,21
758,I really think he would win as an independent.,46
759,He's obviously a smart guy.,27
760,He's super articulate.,22
761,He listens.,11
762,You can tell that he listens.,29
763,"I mean, when you see him interact with people, he's, he's very genuine, how he interacts.",89
764,"He's built businesses, right?",29
765,"He's built big, well, really, uh, productive businesses that are doing great.",77
766,"He's, I think he'd be great.",28
767,It's got a fantastic work ethic.,32
768,"I got a fantastic work ethic that he, you know, he built, he came up from nothing, right?",89
769,He had seven bucks in his pocket.,33
770,"We all know the story and, and he has more bucks in his pocket than that now.",77
771,"So, and most important, I think, I think he's just a popular guy.",65
772,"You know, he would get up and, and when the country's going through hard times, you know, it's talking to a friend on the way up here and they were saying, hey, you know, people want leadership and they're looking for it and, and they're not hearing it.",253
773,And a lot of times people don't even recognize the fact that they don't have leadership.,88
774,"They, they don't even recognize it.",35
775,It's a leadership vacuum.,25
776,"So, they don't even know what they should be thinking.",54
777,"Well, let me give you an example.",33
778,"You're, let's take a seal platoon.",34
779,"Seal platoon, raids a house.",28
780,There's some explosions.,24
781,There's some gunfire and no one's really sure where it's coming from and no one's really sure what to do.,105
782,"Now, that individual, a lot of the individuals in that platoon are just kind of holding on security.",100
783,"They're holding their, they're not really sure what to do.",58
784,And they're not really even recognizing that there's a leadership vacuum.,73
785,"But then someone comes in, the leader, the platoon chief, the platoon commander comes in and goes, everyone get to the roof right now.",134
786,"And then we're like, oh, cool.",30
787,Now we know what to do.,23
788,So same thing happening in America right now.,45
789,"There's no kind of voice saying, hey, everyone.",47
790,This is what I just saw on this video.,38
791,This is what I just saw.,24
792,This was a heinous crime.,25
793,This obviously we have some deep rooted problems that we need to fix.,69
794,"Here's the way I'm going to move forward addressing these problems, getting to the bottom of them.",98
795,And here's how long the timeline is going to be.,48
796,"And by the way, my ears are open and you know where the place, you know where I'm coming right now?",99
797,I'll be in Minneapolis tomorrow afternoon.,42
798,"That's, you know, like, oh, we got a problem like that.",55
799,"If we have a problem like that, I am going on the ground.",57
800,I will be there.,16
801,I'll be there.,14
802,"I'm the guy, I'm the president.",31
803,So I'll be there in what two hours.,35
804,I'll be there on the ground.,28
805,I'm going to find out what's going on.,38
806,I'm going to meet with people.,30
807,We're going to talk.,20
808,I'm going to listen.,20
809,I'm going to find out what this means.,38
810,I'm going to get to the bottom of these problems.,49
811,"That's what then you can actually speak from a position of, okay, I just spoke to these nine people.",100
812,"Matter of fact, they're coming with me.",39
813,We're going to come up with a plan.,35
814,We're going to come up with a plan together.,44
815,"You know, that's another huge leadership.",41
816,"Everyone thinks in the military that the leader's sitting at the top going, all right, gentlemen, here's what we're going to do.",128
817,We're going to approach this building from the west.,52
818,We're going to assault the front door.,38
819,"No, that's not the way it works.",32
820,That's not the way it should work.,34
821,"The way it should work is I say to you, Joe, I say, hey, Joe, here's the target.",80
822,I want you to go after tonight.,31
823,Come up with a plan.,20
824,"And you say, okay, cool.",24
825,"And then you, if you're a good leader, you get with your team and say, hey guys, here's the target.",99
826,We're going after how do you all think we should do it?,55
827,And now you all come up with your own plan together.,52
828,"And then you come back to me and say, hey, Jaco, here's how I want to do it.",76
829,"And I said, looks good.",23
830,"And maybe if I got to make a little adjustment, I say, hey, make this a little adjustment here or maybe use this a weapon over here or whatever.",144
831,"I make little tiny adjustments, but it's still your plan.",57
832,"And from a leadership perspective, that means you are, you and your team are totally bought into the plan.",106
833,You made it up.,15
834,As opposed to me coming down and barking orders at you and telling you how we're going to do it doesn't work.,109
835,"I mean, I can force you to do it because I outrank you.",55
836,"No, I order you to do this.",27
837,That doesn't fly.,17
838,"You know how many times in my entire military career, I said, hey, I'm the boss.",80
839,You better do what I tell you to do.,36
840,You want to know how many times I said that?,44
841,Zero.,5
842,Zero times.,11
843,No one thinks like that.,24
844,"So in a leadership position, what you have to do is say, hey, I'm going to come.",80
845,I'm going to find out what's going on.,38
846,I'm going to talk to people and we're going to put together a plan to figure out how we're going to get this solved.,116
847,This is not acceptable in America.,34
848,That sounds fantastic.,22
849,"But what if you're a Republican and they're Democrats and then you get on the ground and you have a mayor that's non-compliant, you have a governor that disagrees with your strategy, they don't want you there in the first place, they want to work it out themselves, they want to defund the police, they're voting unanimously to defund the police.",346
850,They don't like what you're saying.,35
851,Cool.,5
852,Okay.,5
853,"If that's where we're at right now, let's come up with a plan.",62
854,Let's see how we get through this.,34
855,"Here's some things I'm worried about because if you, if you're telling me you want to defund the police because you think that this police department is completely and utterly corrupt, okay, let's, let's explore that because you could be right.",244
856,You could be right.,19
857,"This is where a lot of leaders make a mistake where it becomes an ego thing, especially you're like, you're talking Republican and Democrats.",141
858,"So that means if I'm a Republican, no Democrat can have a good idea ever.",73
859,"And if I'm a Democrat, no Republican can have a good idea ever.",63
860,That's completely wrong.,24
861,That's completely wrong.,24
862,"So even right now, like when you threaten me right now, right now, you're like, hey, what if I tell you I want to defund the police and I want to tell you I don't want the cops and I want you to tell me all those things as a good leader.",237
863,You know what I'm gonna say?,28
864,All right.,10
865,There must be something really bad going on here beyond even what I just saw on this video.,91
866,I'm coming and I want to hear what's happening and I want you to tell me what your suggestions are.,99
867,"And if your suggestions are to defund the police, let's explore where that, where that plays out.",97
868,"Let's see where that ends up because as we start peeling back the layers, even the most, the most ardent anti police person, you're going to get to a point where you say, okay, when my house is when one of your constituents house is being broken into, who are they going to call?",279
869,What mechanism are we going to put in place for security?,57
870,How are we going to keep people safe from crime?,48
871,And then they've got to answer that question.,45
872,And maybe they come up with a good answer.,42
873,I don't know yet.,17
874,"But as a leader, you have to listen to other people's ideas.",60
875,"And we have to, you absolutely have to do that.",47
876,"There's a saying from Patten, leader on the front line is always right.",71
877,The leader on the front line is always right.,45
878,"So I've always tried to embrace that theory, not just from a leadership perspective, but even from a human perspective.",119
879,"You know, when you want to tell me something that I don't know about, I'm going to listen to you.",97
880,"I'm actually going to, I'm actually really going to listen to you.",66
881,"I'm going to try and ask myself, well, let's see, Joe lives in this city and Joe's here with this community.",108
882,And Joe is telling me right now that we should have no police here.,67
883,"Well, could he be very emotional?",33
884,"Yes, he could.",14
885,Does that mean I should not listen to anything?,47
886,"He says, no, it doesn't.",24
887,Means I should monitor your emotions and I should take that into account.,73
888,"But I should also be saying, there's got to be some core of truth to what he's saying.",86
889,"Now, is it possible that Joe is just a bad actor and just evil?",63
890,"Yes, it is.",11
891,How do I know that unless I listen to you?,42
892,Is there a answer as you don't?,31
893,You know what I'm hearing right now?,36
894,Jocco and the rock 2020.,24
895,That's what I'm hearing.,24
896,"Come on, son.",13
897,I think.,8
898,I need you.,11
899,Yeah.,5
900,"Well, I really hope it doesn't get to that point.",49
901,Like saying all makes fantastic sense.,38
902,But the problem is everybody is so partisan.,44
903,"It's so difficult to get people to work together and people are so, there's so much invested in keeping this party divided by these party lines, keeping the country divided by the right and the left.",199
904,It's so nuts.,13
905,It's completely nuts.,21
906,It's completely nuts.,21
907,"And when you hear the extremists on either side, you should say to yourself, you should say to yourself, they want us to fight.",127
908,Right?,6
909,"It's like, you know, here, I'll drop dime on myself.",52
910,"I'm a big, like when I was a kid in the SEAL teams, I was an instigator.",72
911,"If I could talk smack to two different people and let them start to get escalating like they wanted to fight, I would do that all day long, especially once I started training people, Jiu Jitsu, you know, I'd be the guy that was saying, oh, he thinks he could take you now because he trained for two weeks.",305
912,You haven't been here.,22
913,"And he said, what do you, he said that, you know, I would do that all day long, escalate.",89
914,So we have to do that because it's fun to watch people fight to the death.,74
915,That's what I did when I was on fear factor.,44
916,It's always instigating people.,31
917,It's fun.,9
918,"Yeah, there's, there's some level of fun to it.",47
919,"Yeah, but fighting to the death is, there's a different kind of fun.",68
920,"Yeah, but when you recognize that when people on the extremes are telling you extreme things that what they want is to create a divide, that's what they want so that you just go, you know what, I just can't have that song vote in here or I just can't have this song vote in here.",279
921,"It's a, it's a nightmare.",25
922,It is a nightmare.,18
923,It's a very difficult one to get out of.,40
924,You need real leadership to get out of it.,42
925,Yeah.,5
926,And that's just absent right now on both sides.,47
927,Totally absent and there's no middle ground.,44
928,"No, no, there's no one that says, well, you know, I, I, you know, I, I like some of Trump's policies, right?",108
929,Someone says that.,18
930,"It's like, oh, just destroy that person.",40
931,You must be a nuts.,19
932,Yeah.,5
933,"I agree with, I agree with Nancy Pelosi on this thing.",54
934,"You must be, you know, a communist, you know, either way, but that's the way, that's where we're at.",100
935,"Yeah, that's why unfortunately, well, fortunately, unfortunately, but if, if the rock was going to run, I think he would own, I think you would have to run as an independent, right, to just say, listen, I'm not down.",216
936,There's some things I agree with over there.,44
937,There's some things I agree with over there.,44
938,So you know what I'm doing?,27
939,"I'm going in the middle, which is where most of America is.",59
940,"So if you want to vote extremist, you can go to this side, other extremist, you can go to this side.",100
941,Everyone else vote for me.,26
942,But when was the last time someone even won as a governor that was an independent?,82
943,Was it Jesse Ventura?,21
944,Possibly.,9
945,Minnesota.,10
946,"Yeah, possibly.",15
947,It might have been him.,23
948,"I mean, you never even hear about it.",37
949,Yeah.,5
950,"Well, there's, there's a whole like money thing that happens, right?",68
951,Yeah.,5
952,"There's a whole money thing where if you're not a Republican or a Democrat, you're not going to get those big coffers full of money to put paid advertising out and get people in the streets to vote for you.",206
953,"Yeah, you don't have the machine behind you, you know, the DNC behind you or the Republican party.",98
954,"Yeah, it's, it's a real weird situation we find ourselves in with no clear path to sanity.",90
955,There's no clear path to sanity if we don't talk to each other and right now we're not.,87
956,Yeah.,5
957,We're not.,10
958,"I've seen, you know, the people are so just angry, just angry when you talk to them about this stuff.",101
959,Just anger comes out.,21
960,It's horrible.,14
961,It's horrible to watch.,23
962,Yeah.,5
963,"What, what disturbs me is that I don't see, I mean, in the past when there's been disputes or things have been wrong, it seems like there's a clear path to, to sort of work things out.",184
964,It doesn't seem like a clear path.,34
965,"It seems like every day it kind of gets a little worse, like people get ramped up even more.",92
966,"And then there's this event that's looming on the horizon, this November event, this election event, no matter what, whether it's left or right, whether Biden wins or Trump wins, it's going to be madness and chaos.",214
967,"It seems hard for me to understand that Biden could, it could maintain his health, you know, through a presidency.",114
968,That seems very challenging to me.,34
969,Yeah.,5
970,"I mean, it seems like he's been going down, you know, with his coherence level.",79
971,"You can kind of see it over even months, right?",47
972,"He's on a really, really rapid downward spiral.",47
973,"Well, it seems stressful for anybody.",37
974,It's a Trump for whatever fucking reason.,41
975,That guy eats it up.,20
976,"But for most people running for president alone, just the grueling, just the schedule that's involved and traveling and doing all these speeches and it just breaks them down.",174
977,"I mean, one of the reasons why Hillary lost was she just wasn't willing to travel as much.",90
978,There was all these different events that she was supposed to go to.,68
979,She just couldn't go.,21
980,She couldn't take it anymore.,29
981,"She thought she was going to win anyway, so she just stayed laid back.",70
982,Yeah.,5
983,Yeah.,5
984,"Hillary is a brutal thing, but it's really also just completely insane that the two candidates are these two people.",116
985,"Well, yeah, first of all, the best the Democrats could do.",58
986,"I mean, they had all these other people that were well spoken.",62
987,Yeah.,5
988,It seemed like young and healthy and there's so many.,53
989,That is hard to comprehend.,27
990,Yeah.,5
991,It's really hard to comprehend that.,36
992,"That you're looking at this group of whatever, we have 350 million people, 320 million people in America and this is who you end up with.",137
993,"Yeah, I mean, fucking anybody but Biden, anybody.",49
994,"I mean, we don't even know who his vice president is, right?",60
995,That's going to make a big deal.,32
996,"That's going to be a big deal because the vice president is compelling and interesting and he says he's going to pick a woman, whether he picks the problem, it was going to pick Klobuchar.",188
997,Klobuchar was responsible for a lot of those guys skating in Minneapolis.,73
998,So that's not good.,19
999,"And then if he's going to go with Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard kind of took the legs out of that lady.",102
1000,So then who's left?,19
1001,"Mayor Pete, he seems like a guy who's just, you know, like he's got a playbook.",79
1002,He's kind of like following this Obama playbook and I just don't feel it from him at all.,89
1003,At least he's gay.,18
1004,We'd have a gay guy in office that would lighten people up a little bit.,72
1005,I believe that.,15
1006,We had a powerful gay leader.,29
1007,I think it'd be great for the country.,38
1008,"Like I think, you know, like the, the, the, one of the things about Obama being in office beside the fact, being in office, beside the fact that he's very articulate and educated and so well spoken statesman, is that it's like, hey, look, we're making progress.",261
1009,We have a black president.,26
1010,Like I felt that.,17
1011,I felt like a wave across the country.,38
1012,"People like, you, you can be president in this country.",55
1013,"Like even if you're born out of a single family, single mother family and you're a black guy, you can, as long as you got the goods, you can make it.",149
1014,Like this is great.,19
1015,This means we really are living in a meritocracy and it would be great if there was a gay guy that had the same experience.,123
1016,"Like, like all the people that are homophobes, like, yeah, but that fucking mayor, he's got me.",95
1017,"Yeah, I'm not the Bible says, but you know what?",48
1018,Fuck the Bible.,15
1019,I'm voting for that guy.,24
1020,He's better than Trump.,23
1021,"I mean, that would be great, but he's just, I don't think he's the guy.",71
1022,Maybe he's the guy someday.,27
1023,"He's also a young guy, right?",29
1024,So who else?,12
1025,Who the fuck is there?,22
1026,Especially since it's going to be Biden and he said it's going to be a woman.,77
1027,He's definitely not going to go with Tulsi.,43
1028,She's too fucking dangerous.,28
1029,The Democrats are scared of her.,32
1030,She doesn't play games.,23
1031,Which is so crazy.,18
1032,I know she's got everything.,28
1033,Everything they want.,21
1034,"Woman of color, Congresswoman served overseas, two deployments.",63
1035,Yeah.,5
1036,She's got everything.,21
1037,She's super articulate.,23
1038,She's level headed.,19
1039,Super level headed.,19
1040,Very intelligent.,17
1041,But she's just not corrupt.,27
1042,She's got this one problem.,27
1043,That's the one problem.,23
1044,"I mean, other than that, you look at it like Jesus Christ is lady.",66
1045,She's willing to talk to people on the other side.,50
1046,"She's, you know, she's a, a stateswoman.",40
1047,"She's a, you know, the way she speaks.",38
1048,She speaks like a leader.,25
1049,There won't even consider her.,30
1050,She's too dangerous.,20
1051,"Well, I'm going back to DJ, Duane Narak Johnson.",48
1052,Yes.,4
1053,That's what I'm saying.,23
1054,Independent.,12
1055,Yeah.,5
1056,Yeah.,5
1057,"And Duane and Jaco, 2020.",25
1058,"Come on, man.",13
1059,We need you.,12
1060,"Uh, it's, it's very, very, it's very horrible.",46
1061,"And, and when I see all this divide, right, this is one thing that just, two, two have been in the military and have been on the battlefield and fought alongside guys.",167
1062,"Of every background, every background that you can imagine, white, black, Mexican, whatever, Puerto Rican, Asian, they're, uh, everyone's out there.",148
1063,Everyone's out there.,21
1064,"And by the way, going to memorial services for these guys overseas, there's not one thought in your head.",105
1065,"There's not one thought in your head that's thinking, oh, underneath the, the flag on that coffin, is that a black guy or that a white guy?",139
1066,"Not one thought in your head is thinking that in any way, shape or form.",72
1067,"Well, you know, is that that person took a bullet, got blown up.",64
1068,That could be me.,17
1069,They took that for me.,22
1070,"And to come back here and, and now see this, this, this country being ripped apart.",83
1071,"It's, that's the most horrible thing for me.",44
1072,"This is something that gets discussed a lot by guys and teams and by different guys in the military period that when you've served overseas with, with these guys, that racism becomes the least, the least considered thing.",221
1073,"It's your, your brothers, because you're literally the consequences of your actions, the consequences of your day to day existence is so, so dire life and death.",161
1074,It's the most drastic consequences that we are aware of.,56
1075,There's nothing you're losing your life or you're not or they save you or they don't.,85
1076,"Your brothers, you're all together.",35
1077,"But in this world, the consequences are less grave and the requirements of people are less extreme.",99
1078,You're not as tested.,21
1079,"You're not, your character is not exposed.",42
1080,"You are not as, you're not as vulnerable in that sense.",55
1081,"And because of that, I think people are more outraged and they're finding more reasons why we're separate.",106
1082,More reasons to divide us.,26
1083,"More reasons why they're different from us, whether it's because of ideology or skin color.",91
1084,Sam Harris has a podcast where he's discussing all the different things and he brings it one really great point.,112
1085,The podcast that's out now.,27
1086,"He said, could you imagine a world where we think of color the same way we think of hair color?",95
1087,Like the color of people's skin is the same way.,48
1088,Could you imagine a world where I don't trust redheads?,55
1089,"I don't, those people with dark brown hair are fucking creepy to me.",68
1090,"You know, all the people in my neighborhood that are blonde, they're all shady.",79
1091,That seems so preposterous.,27
1092,"Well one day, the goal would be so great.",41
1093,"If one day, that's how we feel about all skin color.",52
1094,It's no different than hair color.,34
1095,"It's just characteristics that you were born with, that you have no control over.",81
1096,Who you are is what's important.,32
1097,That's it.,10
1098,That's what that's the position that the military puts you in.,62
1099,"It puts you in this position of, look, I got to rely on this guy.",65
1100,I got to rely on this guy.,26
1101,"And if they're reliable, I'm down.",34
1102,I'm good.,9
1103,"If they're not reliable, I got a problem.",41
1104,"It doesn't matter what color they are, it doesn't matter what they're, it doesn't matter any of that.",101
1105,"It's like, is this person going to be there?",44
1106,Is this a good person that's going to be there to back me up?,61
1107,That's all we care about.,25
1108,"For me, this is super regressive to be going through this, to watch the country go through this and think, how did, wait, wasn't I just 10 years ago overseas with a bunch of guys and we didn't care about any of this?",216
1109,Didn't enter into our minds.,28
1110,We're not looking at it all the time.,37
1111,And I guess part of it is because you're in a fight.,52
1112,You're in a struggle.,21
1113,"And right now, let's face it, in America, there's not a lot of struggling happening.",84
1114,We're kind of making our own struggle right now.,48
1115,Exactly.,8
1116,"And I think one of the things you've talked about that's very important is that a lot of this divide is because of this really shitty way of communicating, whether it's through social media or whether it's through reading stories or watching videos.",249
1117,"It's a terrible way to not just get in for information, but it's a terrible way to interact with people.",104
1118,"Like, the way to interact with people is the way you and I are doing it right now.",82
1119,Talk to people and I think the vast majority of problems would be solved amongst reasonable people if they just talked through.,127
1120,"They just talk to try to figure out, you know, you know, hey man, I didn't like that you did this.",98
1121,"Well, what did I, well, all right, well, I was thinking when I did this, here's what, you're right.",99
1122,Here's why I did it.,20
1123,And this is what I was thinking and I was wrong because of that.,64
1124,"And if people could just say that and people could accept that, people could shake hands or hug it out.",103
1125,"And rather than have a fucking Twitter beef that leads to a gun fight, I mean, literally that's the way we exchange information with each other back and forth through social media is the absolute worst way people can talk.",222
1126,You're not looking at each other.,33
1127,You don't get any social cues.,30
1128,You don't feel any empathy towards that person that you're not in front of them.,80
1129,You're not there.,17
1130,"And you're looking to see how many people agree or disagree, who's liking or dislike because it's a public thing, right?",120
1131,So how many likes do they get?,30
1132,Their thing got 400 likes.,26
1133,Mine only got 20.,17
1134,Shit.,5
1135,You're wrong here?,18
1136,It's just a terrible way for us.,32
1137,It's a new found way for us to communicate and a terrible way for us to communicate.,84
1138,"It's not, we're not designed for it.",36
1139,This is not how we evolved.,27
1140,We evolved to communicate with social cues and to look at each other and be around each other.,94
1141,"And you know, you could say something to a person and you're both laughing or you see it written down the same way.",115
1142,"And you're like, that has a fucking asshole.",44
1143,Yeah.,5
1144,"Even from a leadership perspective, we'll talk about this a lot with, hey, I'll send you an email that says, hey, Joe, can you get this project done next week?",159
1145,Thanks.,7
1146,And you're in a bad mood when you read that.,44
1147,"You know, you're like, who the hell do you think you're telling?",64
1148,"But if I was like, hey, Joe, can you get this project done by next week?",72
1149,We really need it.,18
1150,I'm looking at you and kind of give me a blank stare and I explained it to you a little bit more and all of a sudden it turns into a perfectly good conversation.,161
1151,Exactly.,8
1152,"But when I send you that email or in this case, a tweet, then you hate me.",74
1153,Yeah.,5
1154,"It's like we got management to do, right?",41
1155,"You got to, when you want something out of someone or you want some things to get done, you got to manage that person's personality and mood and you got to manage the relationship that you have with each other.",210
1156,And you have to be proactive.,29
1157,"You have to, you have to call them, it's up man.",48
1158,How you doing?,14
1159,Everything good?,16
1160,You good?,9
1161,"Like, they have to get a good feeling out of you.",49
1162,Yeah.,5
1163,"Like, I got to ask you this favor, I need this thing from you.",62
1164,And then you're rolling and everything's good.,46
1165,Exactly.,8
1166,"If you don't do it that way, then people go, fuck this guy.",59
1167,"Well, this guy just wants things from me or this guy's annoying or, you know, this guy's treating me like a bitch.",114
1168,Exactly.,8
1169,Yeah.,5
1170,The world through Zoom right now.,33
1171,So we're doing a lot of zooming.,32
1172,So my company has it on front.,30
1173,"The, just the video alone increases your ability to communicate, right?",71
1174,Massively.,10
1175,It doesn't get all the way there.,33
1176,But just being able to look at someone and have a conversation with them as opposed to either just a here and a phone or absolutely.,132
1177,"So, so that idea of, hey, I'm actually going to sit down and talk to you.",73
1178,I'm actually going to sit down.,31
1179,"Hey, I'll meet you.",19
1180,"The are like we pivoted obviously once, you know, we used to go into or we still do, but going into businesses and working with them.",133
1181,"Shake and hands, how you doing, talking to them.",48
1182,"And then all of a sudden in three days, we were doing everything online.",72
1183,Everything.,11
1184,"Hey, meet me on this Zoom call.",31
1185,You can get there.,18
1186,You can get 97% effectiveness just by looking at someone and talking to them.,77
1187,"You know, as, like I said, there's a little percentage that you're still not going to get.",90
1188,"But if you think you're going to communicate effectively through social media tweets, you're just freaking wrong.",113
1189,"Yeah, that's one step below email, right?",41
1190,Social media tweets is one step below email.,44
1191,Emails one step above that.,27
1192,Phone calls is one step above that.,35
1193,Zoom is a step above that.,26
1194,Another layer.,14
1195,Person of persons the best.,27
1196,Person of persons.,18
1197,That's what we're designed for.,31
1198,"Everything else is just, it's, and that's what's leading to all this fucking madness in chaos.",94
1199,That's a lot of it is fueled.,29
1200,"It's weaponized by, by social media tweets.",43
1201,"And yeah, because by the way, when you send me a tweet to be, to be an asshole to me, I, I actually just retweet that and tell everyone what an asshole you are.",160
1202,A bunch of people retweeted as well.,36
1203,Yeah.,5
1204,"They're like, it may have.",26
1205,"Oh, God.",8
1206,"We're not, we're not working together.",38
1207,Right?,6
1208,"That's another thing that COVID did, right?",43
1209,"All of a sudden, we took everyone and isolated them.",52
1210,"You're not, you're not seeing them.",35
1211,Yeah.,5
1212,You're not talking to them.,27
1213,So now everyone is almost strictly communicating by these methods that you're talking about.,92
1214,"This is horrible, horrible for society.",39
1215,Horrible for society.,21
1216,"The idea of coming to work in a place, right?",45
1217,"The idea of, hey, I'm going to show up and work at a place with other people.",77
1218,That is such a huge part of getting back to where we need to be.,64
1219,"Like when you pull everyone out of work and there, and even worse, and I'm not even just beyond COVID, you know, what happens?",126
1220,"We've moved all manufacturing overseas, right?",46
1221,"So all those people that used to go and work in the same place every day, that used to show up and have a common mission and a common goal, they don't have that anymore.",169
1222,Much of the middle class doesn't have that anymore.,51
1223,They used to have it.,21
1224,They don't have it anymore.,27
1225,And that's interestingly China's middle class is growing right now.,67
1226,Why is there middle class growing?,34
1227,Because they're manufacturing.,30
1228,They're making things.,22
1229,"They're filling that void of people that have that level of skill set of, hey, you know what?",93
1230,I just got out of high school.,30
1231,I can't afford college.,23
1232,So what am I going to do?,25
1233,Right?,6
1234,"Oh, well, in China, well, you can say, okay, well, I guess I'm going to work at a factory.",90
1235,"Hey, it's a horrible sweatshirt.",32
1236,"It's whatever we need, that they need to improve their, their conditions.",73
1237,"But hey, these people have a job.",33
1238,They have a purpose.,20
1239,They're moving into certain direction.,38
1240,"In America, we've kind of, all a massive scale gotten rid of that class of people's purpose.",92
1241,"And that's a big focus for you, right?",38
1242,You're company origin in particular.,36
1243,Yeah.,5
1244,"Oh, which by the way, I got the boots.",38
1245,They're fucking dope.,21
1246,You guys make great shit.,25
1247,"It's like really high quality, really beautifully manufactured stuff.",69
1248,And there's something very valuable right now about American made.,66
1249,"It used to be, it was very divisive.",36
1250,"Like you said, American made like, what are you?",48
1251,"A xenobobic, you know, like foreigners, what the fuck is wrong with you?",72
1252,"But now you realize like, oh, with COVID, you know, we were cut off from even getting goods and supplies from other countries.",126
1253,And then we were getting so much of our medical supplies from China.,68
1254,"And then we were getting so much of our vaccines and medicine, all these different things manufactured by China.",112
1255,"You're like, hey, why don't we do that here?",44
1256,"What we used to, but I was cheaper by like a dollar thing to send it over there.",80
1257,"Like, oh, Christ.",17
1258,And people are realizing now there's a great benefit to making things here in America.,86
1259,And it's not just this idea of national pride.,46
1260,National pride's great.,23
1261,"But also like, you don't have to go anywhere to get things and you keep jobs here.",82
1262,Yeah.,5
1263,And I think Kanye West is looking to build the same thing as we're doing.,73
1264,He wants to manufacture stuff in America.,41
1265,Why?,4
1266,"Because he knows when you have a bunch of under-privileged kids, the best thing you can provide, a bunch of under-privileged kids is jobs.",138
1267,Jobs that they can entry-level jobs.,36
1268,"Hey, no, when I was a kid, it was almost like, hey, if you're not careful, you're going to end up working in the factory, right?",128
1269,"That's what's going to, you know, you can end up working in a factory.",70
1270,No one wanted a factory job.,28
1271,"The thing is, so that kind of became a mantra, you don't want to work in a factory, you better go to college.",109
1272,"Well, first of all, factory work has changed.",45
1273,There's jobs that people do in a factory that takes a massive skill set.,72
1274,"And the boots, you know, the origin boots, we were probably a year, two years, three years from losing the knowledge of how to actually do that.",144
1275,"And luckily, my buddy Pete has started, you know, grabbing people that know how to do it and passing that information down to the next generation so we can actually be a self-sufficient country.",194
1276,"And we can bring back those jobs of people that, look, that's a proud way to make a living.",91
1277,"These are craftsmen, like you said, these are craftsmen and craftsmen, by the way, our factory is mostly filled with women.",123
1278,And they're out there.,22
1279,They have a skill set.,22
1280,They're learning a skill set.,29
1281,"There's upward mobility as you get better at your job, as you can do more things, you can make more money.",106
1282,"And by the way, you're making something.",40
1283,You're making something with your hands.,40
1284,You're producing something here in this country.,48
1285,"That's just like, well, it's like when you go hunting, when I go hunting, you get something for yourself.",105
1286,There's a certain feeling of being self-sufficient.,51
1287,"And America on a large scale, especially during COVID, we look up and say, wait a second, we can't even, we can't even make that stuff.",135
1288,We don't even know how to make that.,36
1289,That's a nightmare.,19
1290,"Well, the boots in particular, think about it.",46
1291,You started it from scratch.,28
1292,"Like if I started it from scratch, I don't know shit about how to make a boot.",78
1293,"If I had a, it would take, there's a long learning curve of figuring out how to make an excellent boot that fits right and is well made and durable, like those boots that you guys sell.",185
1294,"Like I was going over, I was looking at this thing, I'm like, they fucking put some time and effort into this thing.",116
1295,This is a really well crafted piece of art.,43
1296,"I mean, it's functional artwork.",32
1297,"And that knowledge, because that's not our generation that learned that.",72
1298,"We're pulling that information from the old shoe dogs up in Maine that are 60 years, old 70 years, almost, you know, out of the workforce, having to bring them back into the workforce to educate the younger generation on how to actually do this.",245
1299,"We got a kid up there, the name is Cameron.",43
1300,"Oh, he's 22, he's a young kid.",30
1301,And he has learned now how to weave the material for our geese.,63
1302,So he's the guy that knows how to weave material.,49
1303,"This is the, bro, this is so complicated where you see all these different pieces of string coming together, get this big machine with, so he's got like a loom.",160
1304,"Yeah, he's got, we've got looms up there, but we had to get the knowledge, right, from the old timers that said, okay, let me show you how to do this.",150
1305,"And like you just said, how long would it take to figure out a loom on your own?",80
1306,"First of all, I think I would fail because I don't think I'd have the patience if I just had this machine to look at.",117
1307,"So capturing this knowledge so that we can become a self-sufficient country again, it's got to be paramount in what we're doing.",128
1308,"And it's not just, it's not just, hey, because I'm pro-America.",63
1309,"Yes, I am.",10
1310,"If we want to get rid of the kind of social unrest that we have right now, hey, in Ramadi, you got a 15 year old kid that's putting a roadside bomb in the road.",160
1311,You know why he's doing that?,29
1312,Is he doing it for some big ideology?,37
1313,"No, he's not.",13
1314,He's doing it because he's going to get paid $50 by the insurgents.,67
1315,He wants a job.,15
1316,He wants a life.,16
1317,He wants to make money.,23
1318,What happens in America?,24
1319,What happens with kids in the inner city that are underprivileged when they don't have a job?,93
1320,What are they going to do?,26
1321,"They're going to fall into, oh, maybe I'll sell drugs, maybe I'll commit robberies, whatever I'm going to do, but they're not doing it by choice in many cases or if they're doing it by choice, it's because they don't see any other choices to even make.",252
1322,So we've let our manufacturing go away and now we've got voids.,63
1323,"We've got voids where people don't have an ability to make an income and that's, that's just a complete loss of pride, right?",125
1324,"If you don't have the ability to earn money to take care of yourself, to take care of your family, if you don't have that ability, what are you going to do?",156
1325,You're going to figure out how to make it happen.,49
1326,It's so short-sighted too.,26
1327,"I mean, it was all done for just a small amount of profit per item, small amount of profit per item and it cost the country so much.",132
1328,Yep.,4
1329,"And then the narrative became, we're not able to do it.",55
1330,That's why we don't do it.,26
1331,You're not able to do it.,25
1332,That became the narrative.,26
1333,"Well, you know, even the big corporations would say, well, you know, we'd love to, we'd love to make stuff here, but it's impossible.",133
1334,It's impossible.,16
1335,"Well, that's ridiculous.",24
1336,Completely and totally ridiculous.,34
1337,"It's also like, when you go through Detroit and you realize that Detroit at one point in time in the early 20th century was one of the richest countries in the world or excuse me, one of the richest cities in the world, you go through and you realize, oh, this is where they're making all the fucking badass cars.",313
1338,"All the amazing American cars of the 60s and the 70s, they were all made right there.",85
1339,And then they fucked up.,24
1340,Someone made some decisions to save a little bit of money and make a little bit of money.,89
1341,And completely short-sighted.,29
1342,Didn't look at the economy as a whole.,38
1343,Didn't look at the nation from a position of a patriot.,55
1344,"Someone who looks at the country in a whole, what's best for the country?",73
1345,"Then they said, what is the best way that we can maximize our profit?",69
1346,"Well, we need to set up factories in Mexico and China and all these, all these, all these other places we can get people to work for nothing.",141
1347,You can't buy a fucking cell phone that's made in America.,58
1348,"All the people that designed an engineer's cell phones for Apple, they're right here.",85
1349,They're not making them here.,29
1350,There's not a fucking single cell phone that's made in America.,63
1351,"Try buying one that's made with all American parts, all American labor in America.",82
1352,What?,5
1353,That's such thing.,18
1354,That doesn't exist.,19
1355,"And what you're going to be told is, it can't be done.",54
1356,That's hilarious.,17
1357,Cannot be done.,15
1358,That's what's cool about Elon Musk.,35
1359,Yes.,4
1360,I'll make cars here.,20
1361,I'll make them awesome.,23
1362,I'll make rocket ships.,23
1363,Where the hell is that guy's making?,36
1364,I'm fucking tunnels under the earth.,36
1365,"Yeah, we need a couple more of those dudes.",43
1366,It's good that people are opening their eyes though.,52
1367,It's good that people are realizing because of the pandemic and because of the fact that all goods and services that were being imported on a daily basis were shut down.,169
1368,And also people are terrified of getting things over there.,59
1369,What are you going to spray everything down?,44
1370,Everything's infected.,22
1371,I'm scared.,11
1372,What do I do?,13
1373,But the medicine is the craziest one.,37
1374,"The fact that we rely on China for some ungodly percentage of all of our medicine, like holy shit guys.",103
1375,Is this the right way to do this just for profit?,49
1376,Yeah.,5
1377,It seems like we got a little bit lucky with COVID.,51
1378,Yes.,4
1379,A little bit lucky because it turned out to be not bad.,55
1380,Did you ever get the antibody test?,35
1381,No.,3
1382,"Fuck, should have tested you too.",33
1383,Sorry.,6
1384,"Because you think you might have had it, right?",47
1385,I'm pff.,8
1386,"The end of January, right?",26
1387,"Right as this thing was kicking off, I did a live tour.",55
1388,I did Austin.,13
1389,"Then I did Washington, DC.",26
1390,"Then I did New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, and LA.",57
1391,"Every event shook hands and bro hugged between 1,000 and 2,000 people.",70
1392,That's what I did at the end of January.,40
1393,I went to the absolute ground zero locations for COVID and just bro hugged and talked to a bunch of people and shook hands and just got after it.,145
1394,Then I got sick.,16
1395,"A week later, something two weeks later, I guess it was February.",65
1396,"I was sick and I was like, gee, I wonder what that is.",54
1397,Then March came around and we started here.,43
1398,What's that sick?,17
1399,The sick.,9
1400,"You know, it wasn't real bad.",29
1401,"It wasn't real bad, but it was bad enough that I think I might have skipped.",76
1402,I'm just going to stretch today because I really feel like crap for a workout type of thing.,92
1403,I wasn't down hard.,19
1404,"I didn't miss anything, but I felt bad.",39
1405,I figured that was my COVID experience.,39
1406,My wife got sick.,17
1407,"My son got sick, two daughters in college, and my young daughter didn't get sick at all.",88
1408,My 10 year old daughter didn't get sick at all.,47
1409,"So I was like, yeah.",20
1410,Did you have it or not?,23
1411,I'm thinking of fucking text right now.,39
1412,I'm going to get a doctor in here in an hour and a half before it's done.,73
1413,I'm going to make this happen because I want to find out you would be the only guy that's tested positive if you did.,117
1414,"No, we had Tim's buddy.",23
1415,"What's his name, Ben?",21
1416,He didn't.,10
1417,False positive.,15
1418,Then we tested him again.,25
1419,"Yeah, I think it would be crazy if that travel schedule that I had sitting on all those airplanes from and from all those different airports in all those airports.",163
1420,That's just crazy.,18
1421,Yeah.,5
1422,All right.,10
1423,"I'm asking right now, can we get one to three, three, two, three, two, one.",75
1424,I'm making it happen.,21
1425,"That was another, you know, we're talking about egos.",53
1426,"The scary thing about the whole COVID unraveling was that the leadership wouldn't say, hey, you know what?",106
1427,I actually think I was wrong about this and we're moving to this direction now.,79
1428,Right.,6
1429,"Not just leadership, but everyone.",34
1430,Right.,6
1431,"Everyone just, hey, you know what?",34
1432,I think I was wrong here.,25
1433,But maybe we need to adjust this.,33
1434,"Here's, so you didn't get to see that.",38
1435,That's a great point because that really was a failure of leadership because it was very clear.,95
1436,"It's an important time when they found out when they did the large scale antibodies test, particularly in California and they were like, Jesus Christ, hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to this.",209
1437,This is not what we thought.,28
1438,"Like, and the amount of people that are actually sick, instant result back.",75
1439,"COVID, the amount of it.",24
1440,You did.,8
1441,The amount of people that actually tested positive for the antibodies was way higher than they thought it was.,110
1442,And the amount of people that were actually hospitalized was way lower.,71
1443,And then they looked at the average death that people died.,59
1444,It's actually older than the average death that people died.,60
1445,Yeah.,5
1446,My son pointed that out to me.,30
1447,"Yeah, we shut down the fucking economy for that.",48
1448,Yeah.,5
1449,I guess I was a little bit whatever.,36
1450,I was pretty cavalier through the whole thing.,46
1451,"Our buddy, Dr. Pete, he was a little nervous.",45
1452,"Well, he was way nervous because he was in early, right?",56
1453,"And when you saw the early stuff, when you're like, hey, it's one out of every 10 people are dying.",99
1454,But even he was making adjustments.,35
1455,"He said, wait a second.",23
1456,"In Italy, there's different cities.",35
1457,That was I think where he started changing his attitude.,56
1458,"He said, wait a second.",23
1459,"In Italy, there's different cities.",35
1460,"And in some cities, they're really compressed together and people are old people living with young people in the same place.",124
1461,And all the way to second.,26
1462,We need to separate this out.,29
1463,"And then it just, hey, it wasn't as bad.",40
1464,Thank God.,10
1465,"Yeah, thank God it wasn't as bad.",33
1466,"And my buddy, Andrew Schultz, had a great point.",48
1467,"He said, basically, COVID exposed weaknesses in both business and in people's health.",85
1468,That's what it really did.,26
1469,The lockdown did.,17
1470,Because there was businesses that literally couldn't survive a week without money coming in.,92
1471,"Well, that's a badly managed business or a business that has a very small and narrow profit margin.",99
1472,And then there's people that literally can't survive any sort of disruption in their immune system.,99
1473,Their immune system is shattered.,33
1474,"One of the things that came out of it that I found out from Dr. Ron DePetrick was that 70% of America is deficient in vitamin D. 70%, 29% is severely deficient to the point where like they're like, they have medical issues because of a deficiency in vitamin D. Yeah, you've got to get on that.",293
1475,You've got to get on the vitamin D for sure.,44
1476,You've got to get on the vitamin D and the best way to get it is to get out in the sun.,87
1477,Yeah.,5
1478,"And then the one thing you weren't supposed to do, the whole thing is fucking madness.",86
1479,It was a perfect storm.,23
1480,Yeah.,5
1481,"It's like when the plague in the black plague, they thought it was, they thought it was cats.",93
1482,"They thought cats delivered the plague to everyone so they killed all the cats, but it wasn't the cats.",103
1483,It was the rats and the mice.,29
1484,"And so when you killed the cats, guess what happened to the rats and the mice?",78
1485,They went insane.,17
1486,So almost the same kind of thing you see unfolding.,51
1487,Yeah.,5
1488,"And no one saying, hey, you know what?",38
1489,"Actually, we're wrong here.",27
1490,Right.,6
1491,And what about the masks?,25
1492,So this was crazy.,18
1493,"Well, I got some buddies that texted me.",40
1494,"They said, hey, there's this thing coming.",42
1495,"You origin, you guys should start making masks just to cover your face.",71
1496,"And I said, oh, okay, I don't know anything about this stuff.",61
1497,"I talked to my buddy, Pete, I said, hey, it sounds like we're going to need to make masks.",90
1498,"And he says, okay.",18
1499,"So we start thinking about, hey, how would we make these things?",64
1500,"And then a couple days later, the government comes out and says, mask, don't do anything, don't wear a mask, don't get mask.",124
1501,"So I talked to Pete, I said, hey, man, it looks like this isn't a good, it looks like we don't need to do it because it looks like it doesn't help at all.",154
1502,"Five days later, they're like everyone wear a mask at all times.",64
1503,"And by the way, we're going to pass laws that require you to wear a mask.",73
1504,"I'd call Pete, I'm like, it looks like we need to make masks, you know?",71
1505,And we ended up making a couple hundred thousand masks.,55
1506,"And we were sending them to, this is the weird thing.",53
1507,We're sending them to hospitals.,32
1508,We donated thousands of masks to hospitals.,43
1509,"And, and then, you know, two weeks later, it was like, no, actually, they don't do anything.",92
1510,I still don't know.,19
1511,"Well, it's hard to, the problem is people get shamed.",53
1512,"And the, the World Health Organization came out and basically said the only reason you should be wearing a mask, where does this CDC?",133
1513,"Now the world here to, Fauci said, US government held off promoting face masks because it knew shortages were so bad that even doctors couldn't get enough.",155
1514,So is he just saying that now?,30
1515,"He knows that this morning or today, since we started.",54
1516,So guess what?,14
1517,"You all, every, we all got lied to.",35
1518,We all got lied to.,19
1519,Held off on promoting face masks because it knew shortages were so bad that even doctors couldn't get enough.,109
1520,"Recently, the CDC said the only people that should be wearing masks are people that are treating COVID patients.",112
1521,And that regular people shouldn't be wearing masks.,51
1522,"And then the World Health Organization said that asymptomatic people, it's extremely rare that they transmit to other people.",125
1523,"So we were worried about asymptomatic people, which is the reason why we kept kids at school.",93
1524,"And we were worried about overwhelming the hospitals, which is why we did all this other stuff as well.",103
1525,Which is what brought me crazy about my kid's school.,53
1526,"I was like, Hey, you fucks.",27
1527,This doesn't even kill the kids.,32
1528,It's killing the kids get killed by the flu.,44
1529,"Meanwhile, you don't even scan the teachers or the staff or anybody.",68
1530,People have the flu.,20
1531,They don't want to miss a day of work.,38
1532,They just fucking show up and give it to everybody.,51
1533,That's normal.,14
1534,And kids actually die from the flu.,35
1535,And it's not a small number.,28
1536,It's not a small number of people that die from the flu.,56
1537,"Last year was 62,000.",21
1538,"I mean, it's not as many as COVID, but then you're hearing two camps.",69
1539,"You're hearing one, the COVID deaths are actually under reported.",65
1540,Because a lot of people die from COVID and they don't even register it.,71
1541,Okay.,5
1542,"Boy, I guess it's worse than it is.",35
1543,"And then you're hearing, no, no, no.",36
1544,Actually we're getting incentivized to report deaths as COVID.,62
1545,"Elon Musk on the podcast said, if you got killed by a shark, but you were COVID positive, you would list it as a COVID death.",125
1546,Obviously he was being facetious.,33
1547,"But not entirely because there's a lot of people with leukemia that also had COVID listed as a COVID death, obesity, heart attacks listed as a COVID death because they tested positive for COVID.",194
1548,Cancer also had COVID.,22
1549,COVID.,6
1550,"I mean, fuck.",13
1551,That's really disturbing.,25
1552,"You know, when you hear those statistics, then you see these things that they're saying and just the lack of trust that you end up with the government.",151
1553,Exactly.,8
1554,"And as already people just generally don't really trust the government a lot, right?",84
1555,Right.,6
1556,There's no one that's always thinking the government is always giving them the straight skinny.,95
1557,"And it goes back to this click, baby bullshit.",46
1558,"My wife pointed out this story yesterday where she's reading about this kid that died 17 year old kid, perfectly healthy.",121
1559,"It says she reads into the article, type one diabetes.",54
1560,Type one diabetes is not perfectly healthy.,43
1561,"No, no, that's really sick and fucking dangerous.",49
1562,And you have to take insulin to stay alive.,43
1563,Yeah.,5
1564,And think you can get complications from that.,46
1565,"Like, oh, everyone's living type one diabetes.",46
1566,Diabetics can live real normally.,33
1567,And then they can have an instance that causes them to die.,59
1568,"Yeah, they can have their foot removed.",39
1569,"Yeah, there's all sorts of shit that goes wrong when you have diabetes.",71
1570,Your immune system is severely compromised.,43
1571,But it's like we're our information.,36
1572,It's not pure.,14
1573,We're getting all this muddy thing and Fauci telling us the only reason why they told us not to wear masks is because they knew he didn't have enough.,150
1574,"Like, holy shit, how many people died because of that?",54
1575,You fuck.,9
1576,And then the World Health Organization says actually no one died because of that.,81
1577,You don't have to worry about it.,33
1578,You really don't need to wear a mask.,37
1579,"Like, fucking, what is happening?",33
1580,"The, I think so much of this, ego plays so much into this of people not wanting to admit they're wrong.",103
1581,"Not wanting to, here's another thing that people won't say.",59
1582,I don't know.,13
1583,Right.,6
1584,I don't know.,13
1585,"Like, as a leader, I've been in situations where I did not know.",64
1586,This is how my tell leaders all the time.,41
1587,"They say, listen, tell your people the truth about what's happening.",68
1588,"By the way, we're seeing examples where this is factually not happening inside America right now.",97
1589,"If you're a leader, tell the people the truth about what's going on.",68
1590,That's what you need to do.,27
1591,"And then people come back to me and they say, well, what if, what if I don't know what, what if I don't know the truth?",119
1592,"Then what you do is you say, hey, I don't know the truth.",57
1593,"Hey, guys, I don't know, I don't know exactly how this is going to play out.",76
1594,These are some contingencies that I'm preparing for.,52
1595,That is so much more acceptable from the troops than when you try and pretend like you know what you're talking about.,118
1596,It turns out you're wrong.,26
1597,Right.,6
1598,"I mean, Trump does this so much that people lose track of it, right?",68
1599,Where he thinks something and he just goes out on a limb.,57
1600,"I mean, he just walks right out on a limb and says, hey, this COVID self will be gone in a week.",96
1601,Yeah.,5
1602,"And, and you know, then he just solves off the limb behind his foot.",68
1603,He does that all the time.,26
1604,"It's, it's a good example of how not to lead because then people start to trust you less and less.",98
1605,"And when things like this happen, where you find out that they actually did purposely, now think if they would have said this, like, oh, we're worried about we don't have enough masks.",184
1606,"Then you know what you come out and say, you come out and you say, listen, everyone, we're not 100% sure what the masks do for people.",134
1607,"But we do know this inside of a medical environment, we have to prioritize getting those people that are absolutely exposed.",124
1608,These masks.,12
1609,That is why we are going to put up some kind of a control over who's allowed to buy them.,89
1610,You just tell the truth.,24
1611,"Well, that was kind of happening at some places like Amazon was only doing that.",80
1612,They were only selling those.,29
1613,What is it?,11
1614,N95 masks.,10
1615,And 95s?,8
1616,"Yeah, they were selling them only to hospital workers and there you go.",71
1617,They were allocating them along with other types of hands sanitizer and a bunch of different things they were selling specifically to them first and first responders.,166
1618,Perfect example.,16
1619,Yeah.,5
1620,"What you don't do is say, hey, everyone, don't worry about it.",62
1621,Right.,6
1622,But without you did.,20
1623,"He's saying that, like, hey, fucko, now we can't trust you ever again.",70
1624,Exactly.,8
1625,Yeah.,5
1626,That's the freaking problem.,28
1627,You're looking at this guy.,27
1628,Next time there's some kind of disease.,39
1629,Next time there's a problem.,28
1630,How do we know if we can listen to you?,39
1631,I was also thinking he was saying a couple of weeks ago that the United States doesn't open up soon.,100
1632,We could face permanent damage.,31
1633,"Oh, economic damage?",20
1634,"Yeah, permanent economic damage.",32
1635,You think?,10
1636,Yeah.,5
1637,"I'm like, hey, hey, hey, how come you didn't see this before?",61
1638,"How come you didn't say, hey, we have to weigh in the pros and the cons here, you know?",87
1639,"You should have, and this is actually something that I talked to Peter T about it.",82
1640,"I said, hey, it seems like maybe some people should be quarantined and other people shouldn't.",94
1641,"He's like, yeah, absolutely.",28
1642,"So like my dad, who's an older guy, who's, you know, he's an older guy, compromised immune system.",98
1643,Guess what?,11
1644,He should be isolated.,22
1645,He should be quarantined.,25
1646,"Should my 17 year old son, should my 20 year old daughter, my 20, 2018 year old, my 10 year old, should they be an isolation?",125
1647,Should they be quarantined?,27
1648,Absolutely not.,15
1649,Absolutely not.,15
1650,"Hey, first week, two weeks, we're here and it's a 10% while we're here and all these things cool.",97
1651,You can make an inextremist call.,33
1652,"You can say, hey, guys, I don't know what's happening, but in Italy, it looks real bad.",87
1653,Guess what we're going to do?,29
1654,We're going to shut down for two weeks.,39
1655,"I'm sorry, but this is what we're going to do.",46
1656,"And you go at the nation says, ah, okay.",40
1657,"Okay, we get it.",16
1658,"And then two weeks later, you say, you know what?",49
1659,It looks like it's really might impact our medical systems.,59
1660,We're going to shut down for another two weeks.,47
1661,"Just another two weeks, never goes, you know, I got to pay my mortgage, but okay, two more weeks.",97
1662,"And then you say, then you got to have the courage and the ability to put your ego in check and say, you know what?",115
1663,Thank you.,10
1664,"Maybe, may not have been necessary.",35
1665,"We don't know right now, but it looks like we can start opening back up.",72
1666,Let's rock and roll.,20
1667,"The other problem is once they tell you what to do, they don't want to stop having that power and control.",106
1668,"Oh, yeah, they love that.",25
1669,"Our governor literally said, wear masks because then we can get back some of our freedoms.",90
1670,Yeah.,5
1671,You're going to give away freedom.,34
1672,You got that kind of power?,27
1673,Maybe I should run for governor.,32
1674,Yeah.,5
1675,I didn't know I could just control freedoms.,44
1676,You got my vote.,16
1677,Give away freedoms.,19
1678,"The businesses surviving, right?",32
1679,You're talking about the businesses surviving.,46
1680,"There's a lot of businesses, especially little businesses, right?",65
1681,"Little Jitsy schools, little restaurants.",41
1682,You want a restaurant to operate on 50% capacity.,49
1683,That restaurants aren't making this kind of money where they can throw away 50% of their profits.,97
1684,Exactly.,8
1685,50% of their capability make money.,35
1686,"They still, because they still got to have that cook.",53
1687,Yeah.,5
1688,"They are the dishwashers there, right?",38
1689,There's your bare minimum.,26
1690,And they got to be there no matter what.,40
1691,"If you serve 50 people, great.",30
1692,"If you only serve 25, you don't make any money.",47
1693,Yeah.,5
1694,"So there's going to be, there's a lot of businesses that run that day-to-day, you know, month-to-month paycheck to paycheck to try and stay afloat.",147
1695,That's what America does.,25
1696,And sometimes they're able to creep out of that and they get ahead and that's awesome.,86
1697,That's how you end up with these big powerful companies.,56
1698,"Yeah, I've had a couple of restaurant owners in Adam Perry Lang who owns APL Steakhouse in Janet Sukerino in Evan Funke who own, they own, well, she owns Felix, Janet owns Felix and he's the head chef and they were explained to me profit margins.",246
1699,And it's fucking crazy.,23
1700,"It's, it's, you really look at how difficult it is to run a restaurant and all the decisions that have to be made and, you know, food goes bad if you keep it too long and you've got to buy a certain amount of food, you anticipate a certain amount of customers, you've got to know your customer, he was explaining, you gotta, we know our customers, I know most of them are not going to order this.",396
1701,So I'm going to have certain amount of meals that I'm going to have of the fish and more meals of the steak and the pasta's primary.,132
1702,"That's what most people are coming here for and like, fuck and then you tell them, oh, you can only open up at 60% and waitresses have to wear a fucking hazmat suit and it'll take, God damn man.",194
1703,"One of the 10%, 15%, 5% profit margin.",38
1704,"I think they were saying 14%, this is how they operate, but it's difficult.",75
1705,"It's very difficult and you know, people don't want to spend too much money on meals, you know, and so they, it has to be kind of engineer like how, how, how can you, how can you do it right?",191
1706,"And Janet has had a ton of successful restaurants, like she's a wizard at it.",77
1707,"I mean, she's been doing it straight out of college and her problem was she was in the process of building multiple restaurants.",128
1708,"So all of her money were out, even though she's extremely profitable and very, very successful at all these restaurants, she's building out all these other restaurants at the same time with that money because she knows how to make money.",237
1709,She knows how to run these businesses.,38
1710,So she's doing it.,18
1711,So she's got a Jamaican restaurant.,35
1712,She's got an Italian restaurant.,32
1713,"She's got all these things happening and then boom, the government tells you you have to shut down.",99
1714,"That's, yeah, that's the profit margin.",39
1715,"There's so many bit, you know, because we work with all kinds of different businesses.",86
1716,Yeah.,5
1717,"And the profit margin on many, many businesses is really, really lean.",70
1718,"One of my favorite examples is big construction companies, big construction companies that are doing, you know, $500 million projects or, you know, $700 million bridges and call the seams and stuff.",198
1719,Their profit margin is like 4%.,31
1720,Holy shit.,10
1721,4%.,3
1722,5%.,3
1723,If they do awesomeness like 6%.,31
1724,That is so insane.,18
1725,"And they're, you know, ordering concrete and they've got to have it show at a certain time and then the rebar wasn't in place.",126
1726,Like it's crazy.,16
1727,The margin for error is so small and there's so many businesses that operate like that.,87
1728,"And a lot of times I think some of the people in government, they've never been in business before.",99
1729,"So they don't understand that for them, hey, just operate at 50% capacity inside your restaurant.",97
1730,You'll be fine.,15
1731,That's a very good point.,25
1732,And they've never run a business.,33
1733,"You know, I have a jujitsu gym.",31
1734,We got shut down.,17
1735,"So now, now, we're now they're telling us, hey, you can allow people back in the gym.",85
1736,They just have to be six feet apart.,36
1737,"Well, you can't do jujitsu six feet apart.",42
1738,You can't do Moitai six feet apart.,35
1739,So what are we supposed to do now?,34
1740,"And by the way, what about, oh, you want us to check people and we want to have this, there's all these protocols that are putting in place to have someone come into the gym.",174
1741,So now we got to hire extra people.,35
1742,We got to hire extra cleaning staff because the gym has to shut down for this period of a day and they need to reclean everything.,130
1743,Like obviously the people that are making these rules have never been in business before.,89
1744,"Yeah, telling a person who is running a jujitsu gym, the people have to be six feet apart.",90
1745,The jujitsu is zero apart.,26
1746,Zero feet apart.,16
1747,Zero space.,11
1748,That's the whole goal of jujitsu is smash.,42
1749,"The whole goal, take your body and smash someone's body with it.",64
1750,The whole idea is no space.,27
1751,"That literally is the foundation of jujitsu, a pressure applied with no space.",78
1752,"And this goes back to the idea of as a leader, taking the information from the frontline troops and saying, how you tell me what's a good way to run this?",154
1753,And let's see if we can figure out a solution.,46
1754,"Well, you would really want to talk to jujitsu gym owners.",58
1755,"And my suggestion, I've never run a jujitsu gym.",48
1756,I've been in a shitload of them.,32
1757,My suggestion would be have people fill out a waiver.,53
1758,"So they waive their rights, have people fill out a form that says, I have not tested positive.",94
1759,I've showed no symptoms of illness.,35
1760,"I promise that if I do, I will not train and I will get myself tested.",70
1761,Everything is readily available now.,36
1762,"For a long time, we were getting shamed because we were testing people.",71
1763,I was tracking on that.,23
1764,I was angry that we were testing people.,40
1765,"Look, you can test people too, you fuck.",40
1766,Just like you could buy a steak.,32
1767,It just costs money.,20
1768,You mad that people have steak and you can't afford a steak.,60
1769,"Well, there's people, there are different stages of life in this game called society and capitalism and you start off at square A.",130
1770,"Everybody starts at a different spot, granted.",46
1771,I started at bottom and you figure out a way to get a fucking test.,67
1772,"And if you're in a spot right now in your life where you can't have a test, we'll definitely don't go and expose yourself till we know what the fuck it is.",155
1773,But don't get mad at people who can afford test you crazy fucks.,64
1774,"And what we're at right now with jujitsu gyms is you should have a form that you fill out just like when I was at a restaurant, I went to the Lonesome Dove restaurant, shout out to them in Austin, Texas.",203
1775,Fantastic place.,16
1776,They make you fill out a little form.,37
1777,"Because you have them in test positive, you're not sick, you're not showing any symptoms.",89
1778,"They do a little temperature check, check your forehead.",56
1779,"Oh, you're looking good.",24
1780,"All right, come on in.",22
1781,Sit down.,9
1782,Did they pack you in or did they keep you going?,48
1783,"No, they keep you a little bit separated.",41
1784,"But that was two weeks ago and there's another place, Gus's fried chicken, shout out to Gus's best fucking fried chicken on earth in Austin, Texas.",147
1785,We went there two weeks ago and you couldn't eat there.,55
1786,You had to wear a mask in the restaurant and you had to order takeout.,70
1787,So we got to take out.,22
1788,"We came back again yesterday, yesterday, no fucking mask.",57
1789,Everybody's in their sitting.,29
1790,All the seats are packed.,25
1791,They strongly suggest you wear a mask.,38
1792,And no one's looking for a fucking mask.,40
1793,The waiters are wore masks.,27
1794,But it's like things are getting different.,43
1795,"There's another restaurant, Red Ash that we ate at Saturday night.",66
1796,That place had 75% capacity and you had to wear a mask until you got to your table and then you had to wear a mask again if you had to go take a leak.,150
1797,"You had to put your mask back on, take a leak, come back.",57
1798,And it doesn't make any sense.,30
1799,It's like there's just this health department guidelines and people.,68
1800,They're trying to open up and they don't want to get sued and they don't want to get people mad.,96
1801,"And like, we're trying to protect everybody but we don't know how to do it.",75
1802,And it doesn't matter what the science is.,42
1803,You could show them an article that shows that masks are bullshit and they're still going to tell you but you're still going to wear your mask.,143
1804,Because we're playing a little game here.,41
1805,We're playing a game called Keep People Safe.,45
1806,"Nobody's saying a goddamn thing about take your vitamins, drink water, stay healthy, workout, get out in the sun.",113
1807,"No, the government never says that.",35
1808,"You don't hear it, you got, go, go, go, go, new someone who's fucking goofy slick back here.",92
1809,He's not telling you to go workout and get in the sun.,54
1810,"It's going to be a, I think America can only take so much.",58
1811,"And I kind of said this from the beginning, like you can keep America in lockdown for a little while, two weeks, four weeks.",124
1812,"And then people start saying, you know what?",44
1813,"I got to go out, I got to go make something happen, I got to do something, I got to earn money.",95
1814,"And it's a people that are looking around saying, well, I don't really need to earn money right now.",100
1815,They're the ones that are saying everyone's staying in your house and don't come out and wear a mask.,101
1816,"All right, we got a doctor coming to 330.",41
1817,I told him I think I got you a positive this time.,50
1818,He's wanting to get a positive.,31
1819,"Oh yeah, he got him positive, yeah.",35
1820,"Oh yeah, he got him positive, yeah.",35
1821,"Oh yeah, he got him positive, yeah.",35
1822,"Oh yeah, he got him positive, yeah.",35
1823,He got him a bunch of goddamn healthy people in here.,53
1824,"Yeah, I've had, I think I've had seven, no, eight tests, one, two, three, four, no swabs.",89
1825,"I've had four, yeah, four, no swabs and four antibody tests.",60
1826,I haven't me personally.,24
1827,I've still come out negative every time.,40
1828,"But the other thing that he said, and those doctors are very smart guy and a young healthy guy, he said, that doesn't mean you haven't been exposed to it.",154
1829,"I mean, your immune system did his job.",39
1830,Really?,7
1831,"There's another thing that people are saying, people are saying, oh, well, you just got lucky, you haven't been around someone who had it.",138
1832,"He was, no, no, no.",19
1833,Many of the people that I tested are positive are in a family where the other people that are also in that family are negative.,127
1834,"So they have it, they've been around these people for fucking weeks and they don't get it.",90
1835,Why?,4
1836,"Because they have a better immune system, particularly children.",64
1837,"So I guess I'm going to win, win situation now because if I had it, if I tested positive, it's like see no factor.",114
1838,I powered through it.,21
1839,You beat it.,12
1840,"Now, even if I didn't have it, I'm going to say, hey, see, I beat it.",69
1841,Yeah.,5
1842,"I'm going to win, win.",22
1843,Yeah.,5
1844,"I know, well, depending upon what your results are, I know nine people that have had it now.",92
1845,"And out of those people, only one of them had it bad.",53
1846,"And that was my friend Michael Yo and he got it bad from, it's real, he's in a track.",85
1847,"He flew all the way to New York, no sleep.",42
1848,What was the dates?,19
1849,He was in January.,18
1850,January?,8
1851,Jamie?,6
1852,No.,3
1853,Early February or late January?,31
1854,March.,6
1855,March?,6
1856,Showing New York was March the bear beginning of February.,58
1857,So end of February.,19
1858,End of February he was here.,28
1859,"Yeah, yeah.",11
1860,And then he went.,17
1861,Okay.,5
1862,So he left here that weekend went to New York.,46
1863,No sleep.,9
1864,"Flys to New York, does radio, does TV all say does his comedy gigs, no sleep, does gigs the next day, same deal, does promo all this shit, flies back home, no sleep, gets up in the morning, drives to Vegas with his wife and kids, the fucking kids screaming in the car, ah, drives back home that night, hangs out with his wife's family in Vegas and drives back home that.",370
1865,"So eight hours in the car, just that day.",41
1866,"Then the next day he's got auditions day after that, he's got auditions, then boom, hits the wall and he's fucked.",114
1867,He feels like shit.,19
1868,He felt like shit.,18
1869,"By the way, his mom got it.",27
1870,"She also tested positive, beat it in the day.",45
1871,How long was he down for?,25
1872,He was down for a week.,23
1873,But he ran himself to also vitamin D deficient.,47
1874,"And so all those things ran himself down, vitamin D deficient, doesn't take care of himself.",92
1875,But he caught the perfect storm of exhaustion and travel.,57
1876,Travel fucks you up.,20
1877,It fucks you up.,16
1878,"Yeah, and I leading into this I was traveling.",46
1879,I've been traveling all the time my whole life.,47
1880,"No matter fact, the lockdown is the most consecutive nights I've ever spent with my wife.",89
1881,Since we've been married and we've been married for 20 years.,61
1882,"Most consecutive nights because I was in the Navy, I was deploying, I was going on trips and then when I retired, I was working with consulting all over the place.",163
1883,It's not amazing.,17
1884,"Yeah, so it's been kind of cool hanging out with my wife night after night.",75
1885,"All right, these are FDA approved kits too.",43
1886,So we're good.,14
1887,So we're totally good.,22
1888,We're going to find out for real.,33
1889,Really legit doctors pumped.,28
1890,What do you think you think I've had it or not?,47
1891,What do you think?,18
1892,"Yeah, I would say because your kid, your youngest kid didn't get it, get sick and then the other people did get sick but no one got it badly.",141
1893,And I know your family's very healthy.,38
1894,"I know your daughter's a savage, your son's a savage.",53
1895,I would imagine you probably had it.,36
1896,"Thinking about all the places you've been, I bet you test positive for the antibodies.",86
1897,I know a few digits you guys have got it.,41
1898,But they all just got coughs.,29
1899,"Yeah, plus on top of all this, I'm in my gym.",45
1900,I was in my gym.,16
1901,Oh yeah.,8
1902,"We have all kinds of, we have a lot of people that show up in my gym because they just want to train and want to come check it out.",131
1903,And my gym is big.,18
1904,"We've got 2,000 members.",24
1905,"Yeah, it's 2,000 members.",25
1906,Because it's not just a gym.,28
1907,"What's your victory MMA and fitness in San Diego, California.",61
1908,But so it's a big gym.,22
1909,"And every 2,000 members, that means they're all interacting with three or four other people outside of the gym.",111
1910,That's not five or 10 people.,29
1911,So they're literally sweating each other's mouth.,49
1912,Complete.,9
1913,"Oh yeah, that's another thing.",30
1914,That's another indicator.,25
1915,"When I got sick, my main training partner, this guy, Andy, Andy Burke, who I trained with all the time, he got sick.",116
1916,"And then his girlfriend got sick, who's also a digit survivor, MMA fighter.",75
1917,She got sick too.,17
1918,So we'll see.,13
1919,I'm curious.,12
1920,It's hard.,10
1921,"When you train hard, you get sick.",34
1922,It's part of the thing too.,27
1923,"When you break down your body and your immune system gets, you know, when you're one of those guys that trains really hard, you do have a tendency to get little colds.",167
1924,Because your immune system gets tested.,39
1925,Here's something that I've noticed.,35
1926,"When I have downtime, like let's say this is happening a few times.",67
1927,I'm going to Montana and I'm super stoked.,42
1928,"I'm going to go up there and chill, right?",42
1929,"As soon as I get up there, I get sick.",38
1930,Really?,7
1931,"It's happened to me like maybe three times where I finally have four days or five days where I, you know, don't have anything scheduled to go up there.",151
1932,I'm going to shoot my bow.,26
1933,I'm going to chill and I get up there and it's like my mind switches and all of a sudden I get sick.,100
1934,It's like I saved up illness to where I know I can be allowed to get sick.,74
1935,Has that ever happened to you?,30
1936,"No, but there's a good argument there for like just the way your mind controls your whole system.",97
1937,Yeah.,5
1938,Because your mind is just like pedal to the fucking metal slayer in the back.,77
1939,"Run, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, yeah.",102
1940,"Everything is go, go, go.",25
1941,"And then when it's silence, you're probably like, what have we been up to?",74
1942,I feel like that happens.,25
1943,"I was wondering if it ever happened to you because it's happened enough time that I'm talking about it, right?",110
1944,My best example is camhains.,28
1945,That motherfucker's never sick.,31
1946,"And if he's sick, he still runs anyway.",39
1947,He's just got a little bit of a cough.,38
1948,"Out of all the people that I know, I don't know anybody who's consistently putting in the kind of hours every day that he does.",127
1949,"Oh, yeah.",9
1950,He runs 16 miles every fucking day.,35
1951,Sometimes a marathon.,21
1952,Sometimes a marathon every day while he works eight hours a day and then he gets home and lifts weights.,104
1953,"I mean, it's not like he runs.",30
1954,And he gets his reps in.,24
1955,"Yeah, he gets his reps in with his bow every day.",49
1956,And he's lifting and he's lifting every day every day.,54
1957,He doesn't take days off.,25
1958,That fucking guy's never sick.,30
1959,He's sick.,10
1960,It's like the next day he's running again.,42
1961,"You looking at his Instagram, it's, hey, it's a great day to run.",65
1962,He's out there fucking.,23
1963,I think there's something to forcing your body to consistently and constantly perform.,86
1964,Totally.,8
1965,Yeah.,5
1966,"Imagine not like Olympics, right?",33
1967,"You're in the Olympics for wrestling, let's say.",48
1968,And you've got your whole entire life is on one day.,52
1969,"If you get sick, like, right?",29
1970,Anything bad happens out there?,31
1971,"Yeah, you're done.",18
1972,"Yeah, those big moments like that are fuck.",43
1973,"You're so stressed out too, so your immune system is super jacked.",66
1974,"But I think there's a thing about peaking for a big event, whether it's a fight or the Olympics or something, versus maintaining consistent conditioning.",153
1975,They're very different things.,30
1976,Like a good example is Tim Kennedy.,35
1977,"Tim Kennedy went through, I believe two camps in a row, fight got canceled, kept training, went through another full camp.",122
1978,"And then when he fought Calvin, Gastelum, that guy's never tired and he was gasping out in the fight.",101
1979,And there's a real good indication from all involved that it was because of overtrain.,86
1980,"I know that when I would train fighters, you could absolutely see when they would overtrain.",92
1981,It wasn't a big question.,25
1982,"You'd go in, you'd have a fighter that's whatever level at, let's say, let's say Jiu-Jitsu because I'm training Jiu-Jitsu with them.",132
1983,"And every day, they feel a certain level.",41
1984,And then one day you come in and you train with them and they're just suck.,75
1985,"And I would tell them, hey man, two days off, go eat some steak because you would know 100% that they're overtrained.",117
1986,100%.,5
1987,Would it tell vegans?,21
1988,"Two days off, eat some steak?",29
1989,"Yeah, I would tell them, definitely eat some steak.",51
1990,You need that steak.,20
1991,Get some steak in you.,22
1992,"Yeah, just give them an elk.",28
1993,Just give them just one good piece of backstrap.,48
1994,Just try.,9
1995,Just trust me.,14
1996,Just eat it and run through a fucking wall.,43
1997,"Yeah, it's a really weird thing about watching people go through camps, through fight camps.",92
1998,"And I really, I basically don't train fighters anymore like I used to because I don't have time anymore.",104
1999,But you would work so hard to make sure that on that night that they're there.,78
2000,"Yeah, they're there.",20
2001,And some people get in the cage and they do better than they would normally do.,79
2002,Some people get in the cage and they don't do as good.,54
2003,"And you got Jeremy Stevens, a great example because especially when he first came out, started training with me and he's not with us anymore.",141
2004,"But when he first started training with us, like he was a white belt in Jiu Jitsu.",82
2005,"But man, when he got in the cage, he would just elevate man, like mentally, psychologically to elevate.",103
2006,And he would perform way better in the cage.,44
2007,And then I've had other fighters that you'd get it like they would be kicking people's asses in training and then they get in the cage and it's a down step.,156
2008,And it's so hard to see that.,29
2009,So hard is because sometimes those guys are very committed and they're working hard and they're doing great and they just get in there and just.,144
2010,It's this psychological thing.,30
2011,Some people are dwarfed by the moment.,38
2012,It's very interesting to see.,29
2013,Some people are also afraid of the embarrassment of losing.,59
2014,That's a big one.,17
2015,And they can't trust the process.,33
2016,They can't just remove themselves and just go out there and fight.,66
2017,Do you follow Moitai at all?,28
2018,"A little bit, but not to any great extent.",42
2019,There's a guy who George Hempier brought into his training camp when he was doing the ultimate fighter.,103
2020,John Paul Skarbowski.,21
2021,And he's this French savage Moitai fighter who would basically get drunk every night and showed up at training at GSP's camp drunk.,131
2022,Like he was out all night.,26
2023,"He was in Vegas, right?",23
2024,So the ultimate fighter is in Vegas.,36
2025,Drinks all night.,17
2026,Shows up in the day the next day and fucks everybody up.,56
2027,"And they're like, this is so embarrassing.",42
2028,Like guys were like devastated.,31
2029,Like this guy literally came in holding.,40
2030,He's got a cup.,15
2031,Like from like one of those to go cups and one of Vegas clubs.,62
2032,He showed up in the morning.,28
2033,See if you can find it because it's kind of hilarious.,54
2034,Looks like a guy who should be driving an Uber.,47
2035,Okay.,5
2036,He's not built like a savage.,29
2037,He's just his mind is just he's got the I don't give a fuck and he's got it down.,81
2038,"And was a you know, world champion Moitai fighter beat champions at Lumpini Stadium in Thailand and just amazing fighter.",121
2039,"Well, you know, you always hear about the comparisons of a black belt.",70
2040,"You just do versus a white belt, right?",39
2041,Something that's known.,23
2042,"And it's real, real obvious.",28
2043,"But when you get at a high level of Moitai, it's very similar.",62
2044,"Maybe not quite as similar because there's always this idea that well, you know, I at least know if I throw a punch.",116
2045,I at least know as a human how to throw a punch.,48
2046,"At least there's some idea, right?",34
2047,There's some like a normal human has no idea of how to do an arm lock.,70
2048,Zero.,5
2049,You at least know have some concept of how to throw a punch.,60
2050,So there is a quite a puncher's chance.,39
2051,But I remember the first time I sparred with a real Moitai guy.,63
2052,I was I felt like a white belt.,31
2053,"I was like, oh, okay.",21
2054,"Because I would think about throwing a kick and I would get, you know, kicked myself.",85
2055,I would think about it and get kicked.,38
2056,"Oh, he knows exactly what I'm going to do.",42
2057,Just like a white belt.,23
2058,"You get to, you know, you can predict everything that they're going to do.",74
2059,There he is.,12
2060,So he shows up.,15
2061,"I mean, look, no, six back.",27
2062,"I mean, literally looks like a guy.",35
2063,"If you saw that guy show up, he's like, this is dad, mom, the fucker.",69
2064,Just just he's he showed up straight from the club.,51
2065,"I mean, you can kind of tell he's drunk and he gets in and starts training with these guys.",91
2066,And he even gets to some actual training footage because they were they were humiliated.,88
2067,"I mean, he was ragged on these dudes and beaten a shit out of him and dropping him.",83
2068,"And it looks like nothing, but it's the the problem.",52
2069,"You know, he's a world class kickboxer.",39
2070,And these guys just really have no idea how to handle his movement and the the skills that he has.,98
2071,"Yeah, people underestimate people.",34
2072,"Don't think there's as much of a difference between like a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu and what would be considered an equivalent, you know, world champion in Muay Thai.",165
2073,"Oh, yeah, there's a big step in the step in the ring and see that was out for you.",82
2074,Jiu-Jitsu guys sometimes get cocky about that.,46
2075,I had a buddy mind he was taking an MMA fight and he wasn't doing any striking.,79
2076,He was doing very little striking and he was a really good ground fighter.,74
2077,"And I said, do you know how you can toy with a guy on the ground and they really have no chance?",96
2078,"He goes, yeah, I go, people can do that to you standing.",56
2079,"I go, you have to understand that the fight starts standing.",60
2080,"It's not like you start like it's not EBI rules where you start on the guys back and you know, you have a really good chance of submitting him if you got a great rear neck and choke.",182
2081,This is not that.,17
2082,Yeah.,5
2083,"This is you start 20 feet away from the guy and you're standing and you know, you have to close that distancing.",112
2084,You're not a great wrestler either.,35
2085,"Yeah, well, that's the key component, right?",44
2086,"Yes, it's a giant factor.",25
2087,"Because if you at least if you wrestle, you can go, well, at least I know I have a decent chance of taking him down.",116
2088,"Yes, a decent chance.",21
2089,And even that's no guarantee anymore.,37
2090,"Well, I go back to Mark Schultz when he fought in the UFC.",58
2091,"You know, when Mark Schultz fought in the UFC, you only fought one UFC fight, but that's what we got to see like a world champion, a limp at gold medalist, top of the food chain wrestler.",187
2092,You're only on your feet if you want to be.,43
2093,Like you good luck throwing that punch or kick because you have no chance.,74
2094,"He's going to close the distance and drag you to the ground unless you have really good takedown defense back then when he fought big daddy, good rich people didn't really have it unless they were wrestlers that didn't really have good takedown defense.",253
2095,It had really been established as like a part of the whole skill set of MMA yet.,80
2096,You basically had what you came in there with your karate guy.,62
2097,That's what you had your moitai guy.,36
2098,That's what you got.,20
2099,You got to hope you land that elbow before that guy clenches with you.,70
2100,And there is a there is a overall strategic advantage to grappling.,67
2101,"Yes, because you can close the distance.",40
2102,"And if you're going to punch me, you have to get close enough to you have to make contact with me, which mean I can grab a hold of you and get you down.",152
2103,"That's why that's why the early UFC was like, Oh, you're going to have to get close enough to either punch or kick me.",118
2104,"And when you do that, I can grab a hold of you and get you to the ground.",73
2105,"Also the chaos factor, especially in a street fight, the chaos factor is like bodies are flying.",96
2106,There's bad timing.,19
2107,The clinches have it.,21
2108,"It's not like every, you know, you'll you'll watch the occasional street fight where a guy tees off on some drunk guy and you know, it lands the perfect punch and knocks him out cold.",183
2109,That does happen.,17
2110,But you know what also happens?,31
2111,"Maylay, wild shit, misses and then someone clenches.",52
2112,And then the worst thing in the world is to fight a grappler who's good at takedowns when you're on the concrete.,113
2113,That is the absolute worst thing in the world.,46
2114,You get suplex on your head on the concrete.,44
2115,"I mean, one of the worst things you could ever happen.",54
2116,You're basically getting hit in the head by the world.,54
2117,Yeah.,5
2118,"Well, this is why I, when I talk about, you know, people say, well, what kind of self defense?",94
2119,"You always say jiu jitsu for self defense, but you know, you shouldn't let a street fight go to the ground.",107
2120,"Here's, here's how it works out.",32
2121,"If you come to me and you want to fight me and you like square off like in a boxing stance, I can run away from you.",116
2122,Right?,6
2123,I can just run away.,20
2124,I can just run away.,20
2125,I'm going to get away from you.,31
2126,I don't want to fight you.,26
2127,"If you want to kick me, I can run away from you.",48
2128,"Like, there's my primary self defense as I'm just going to run away from you.",77
2129,"When you grab a hold of me, now everything's different.",55
2130,I can't run away anymore.,25
2131,Now I have to actually know how to handle myself in a grappling situation.,74
2132,So that's why I start with jiu jitsu.,37
2133,"And look, absolutely learn boxing, learn more time, learn wrestling, absolutely no doubt about it.",98
2134,"But the very first thing you need to learn is because if you want to fight me, I can run away.",94
2135,"If you square off and you know, you put your dukes up and say, come on, or you push me.",87
2136,Good.,5
2137,I'm running away.,17
2138,That's fine.,12
2139,I'll take that.,15
2140,"But when soon you grab a hold of me, now I got a problem because I can't run away.",82
2141,The way no problem is the ego where people don't know how to fight and someone puts their dukes up and they decide to see what they can do.,139
2142,"They decide in that moment, do either fake it or just like see if they can possibly hit the guy and then they get a bank.",121
2143,Somebody tees off on them.,26
2144,"Yeah, I think that's, I think the whole thing with CTE right now, that's why I think the popularity of jiu jitsu is going to continue because it's a large part of fighting, same with wrestling, grappling in general.",215
2145,"I think it's going to continue to get more and more popular because of CTE because as a parent, you're not looking, hey, I really want my kid to be sparring a lot when they're 13, right?",186
2146,"No, there's not too many parents that are saying that right now.",64
2147,It's not a good idea.,21
2148,"So I think, but you still want your kids to know how to fight, right?",69
2149,So how are we going to do that?,31
2150,"Well, we're going to teach them jiu jitsu and wrestling and let them have that base.",84
2151,"And then if they get older, hey, should they know how to throw punches?",71
2152,Absolutely.,11
2153,"If they get in the boxing ring sometimes and do some more time matches, absolutely, you should absolutely do that as a human.",125
2154,"But you know, you can do that when you're 17, maybe 16, you can start getting that stuff in, but the kids jiu jitsu, I don't think there's anything else better for them.",169
2155,I completely agree.,19
2156,"And I think with martial arts, with striking, it's good to know just to know distance, just to understand where you're safe and where you're not safe and to understand tells, understand what's happening when someone does this, when someone does this, and then this is common.",275
2157,"And they do this, this is common.",33
2158,Like you should know that because some people don't know that.,62
2159,"You should know how to protect yourself, how to keep your hands up, how to duck under things.",93
2160,You should know that.,21
2161,You should understand the timing.,33
2162,You should understand distance and timing.,42
2163,Those are important things.,27
2164,But fucking swinging knuckles with some guy in the street is so goddamn dangerous.,82
2165,"Because first of all, you don't know what he knows and you're everyone's vulnerable, everyone.",94
2166,Every person that gets punched in the face is vulnerable.,57
2167,"And if you just want to have some sort of a kickboxing match with some man on the concrete, like I don't advise that.",117
2168,No.,3
2169,I advise clench and trip.,25
2170,"Yeah, I advise get out of there.",32
2171,"Yeah, get out there.",20
2172,"Exactly right, advise.",22
2173,"Yeah, definitely if someone wants to start some shit with you, you're absolutely better off just swallowing your ego and getting the fuck out of dogs.",150
2174,"I, that's the warrior kid box.",30
2175,Yeah.,5
2176,"Teach those kids, hey, there's going to be problems, there's going to be bullies.",81
2177,"If you can, you don't need to fight them.",41
2178,"And what's, oh, I'm going to hit me up, you know, because I'm always telling people to change your Jitsu, to change your Jitsu.",127
2179,"That's going to hit me up, you know, I've tried it, but I don't, I want to try and I try it a couple times, but I don't like to fight.",134
2180,"And I'm like, hey, if you don't like the fight to fight, you more than anyone else should learn Jiu Jitsu.",106
2181,"Because if you know Jiu Jitsu, you probably, your chances of having to fight will go down a lot.",96
2182,"Just by the way you carry yourself, just the way by, by the way you present yourself, the chance of you having to fight go down a lot.",134
2183,"Also with Jiu Jitsu, you're involved in real life struggles.",60
2184,"The thing about like karate sparring and a lot of point like light sparring is, it's not the real chaos that comes with an actual fight.",136
2185,Whereas Jiu Jitsu is full blast.,32
2186,Yes.,4
2187,Someone's trying to get you.,28
2188,"It's full, so you get used to full blast.",41
2189,"You get, you get accustomed to it.",34
2190,You know what to expect.,24
2191,"As someone swings for you and you clench with them, you know what it's like to resist with a 100% non-compliant body.",117
2192,"You know, someone's like, fuck, I'm really trying to get away from you.",71
2193,"Really, it's not like play sparring.",36
2194,Yes.,4
2195,You can go full out.,20
2196,And you know where this brings us right back to?,48
2197,Police officers.,16
2198,Yes.,4
2199,"Well, Andrew Yang said it best.",31
2200,"He said, I think that every police officer should be a purple belt.",67
2201,"Oh, that's a purple belt.",25
2202,That's an incredible statement.,31
2203,"It's a good level, right?",25
2204,It's like an attainable level within a couple of years.,55
2205,"But with a couple of years, man, you've got your ass kicked.",60
2206,You've kicked some ass.,23
2207,A purple belt is basically a black belt who hasn't done enough time yet.,72
2208,It's all it is.,15
2209,"I mean, once you've got past blue belt, like blue belt is, I put in the time, I've learned how to do some stuff, and maybe I'll do this.",136
2210,I might make it.,16
2211,I might make purple belt.,25
2212,"Like, you basically, everybody who gets a purple, you want to grab and go, hang in there.",89
2213,You are a fucking black belt.,29
2214,What's better to say?,21
2215,And you're a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu.,37
2216,You're going to be a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu.,45
2217,Just keep fucking going.,24
2218,You already have exhibit enough technique that you could actually one day achieve that.,87
2219,Just keep going.,16
2220,Yeah.,5
2221,"The amount of confidence and mental clarity that cops would have if every cop was a purple belt, it would be amazing.",117
2222,Amazing.,8
2223,Nothing better that we could do than to somehow make that happen.,65
2224,Yeah.,5
2225,Good idea for Andrew Yang.,26
2226,"The horrible video of this guy involved with this lady, and he's a cop and he's talking to this lady and she's not compliant and he grabs her and he fucking brute strength serve to the ground and throws her on her stomach and then gets her in a rear naked choke and people are film this and yeah, it's a terrible rear naked choke.",330
2227,He'd tell he sucks.,19
2228,The whole thing is terrible.,28
2229,"Like, I couldn't imagine a black belt ever handling it that way.",64
2230,Ever.,5
2231,Ever.,5
2232,It wouldn't be so threatened by her.,36
2233,It's not physically threatening at all and you wouldn't want to bully her and to show her that you could throw her around like that.,132
2234,It wouldn't happen.,19
2235,It wouldn't happen.,19
2236,Fear.,5
2237,Right.,6
2238,"That's fear kicking in and it's fear not only of his ego, but he might be legitimately.",87
2239,When's the last thing he put hands on somebody?,47
2240,"I mean, if you put hands on people, you know you don't have to do what he did in that situation.",96
2241,"I haven't seen the video, but you don't, you know, you know you don't have to do that.",86
2242,I think he's just a pussy.,26
2243,"When I'm looking at the video, I'm like, I just think he just wants to throw his weight around, which is another thing you wouldn't do if you know how to fight.",160
2244,That's part of why a lot of people act like that is because they really don't know how to fight.,96
2245,"And that's really, they really don't know how to do that to a grown man.",72
2246,"So when they're doing to someone who they can do it to because they're just bigger, they do it.",95
2247,"They'll force them, they'll impose them so they'll be a bully.",62
2248,"It's horrible to say, but you wouldn't say you're not going to see a black belt doing that to somebody.",103
2249,They're not confident.,22
2250,Exactly.,8
2251,Exactly.,8
2252,It's the same thing with kids.,30
2253,Yes.,4
2254,"I posted some of a few months ago, but it's, you know, some bully thing had popped up.",86
2255,"And I said, Hey, if you want to stop bullying, you know, have kids change your jets, you more tie wrestling.",108
2256,They should have it in school.,30
2257,They should be teaching kids in school.,39
2258,And here's the thing.,21
2259,"People thought, I said, not only will it prevent them from getting bullied, it will prevent them from bullying.",111
2260,Yes.,4
2261,People don't understand people cannot comprehend what that means.,65
2262,And it's exactly what you just said.,36
2263,If somebody actually knows how to fight and you've been humbled and you've been beat down and you've been choked and you know what that feels like and you know what it means and you know how that feels.,202
2264,"The chances of you, look, you could still be an asshole, but the chances of you becoming a bully are way less than if you're insecure and scared and have a, you know, try to make up for your ego by abusing people.",213
2265,That's who becomes bullies with kids and with adults.,53
2266,100%.,5
2267,"The more you train, the more secure you are, the smaller your ego is, the more you're able to step back and see things clearly.",127
2268,"You know, that's one of the horrible things about that.",55
2269,The George Floyd was the other cops.,36
2270,They're not detached from the situation.,40
2271,"They're all wound up in it and Jiu-Jitsu teaches you and fighting teaches you that if you do that, if you allow yourself to get wrapped up into stuff, you're going to, you're going to make bad decisions.",203
2272,"I think also for kids, a lot of the reasons why they do horrible shit is because they have too much fucking energy.",115
2273,They're all jacked up with young hormones.,42
2274,"Oh, yeah.",9
2275,Testosterone.,13
2276,Yeah.,5
2277,Testosterone and... And angst.,30
2278,"And angst and... Bro, it's kind of fun, right?",46
2279,"You know, like, you, it's kind of fun.",38
2280,Like there's mayhem going on.,29
2281,Yeah.,5
2282,"Well, is that the right word?",29
2283,Am I a jerk for saying that?,28
2284,I don't know.,13
2285,"When I was a kid, that kind of mayhem.",38
2286,"I wanted to be a part of it, you know?",38
2287,"And actually, I was talking to one of my LA cop buddies and I was asking him the difference between like the 92 riots.",118
2288,What was it?,12
2289,"92 or 93, Ronnie King.",22
2290,Those riots and these riots.,28
2291,"Those riots, he was like, those were the people that kind of instigated and started and perpetuated those riots.",112
2292,"Those were real like gangsters, like shock callers were making those things happen.",83
2293,"This one, these riots were...",29
2294,"He was like, yeah, these are kids.",34
2295,These are kids that drove down from Riverside.,46
2296,"These are kids that, you know, and sure, some of their, some of their attitudes was like, hey, there's been, you know, injustices against police.",145
2297,We want to stand up to that.,28
2298,Got it.,7
2299,"And then instead, of course, there's a criminal element as well that are legit, normal, robbery crews that are saying, oh cool, we got some good cover right now.",161
2300,"Let's get in there and make some, you know, steal some stuff and we probably won't get caught.",94
2301,But that's a big difference.,28
2302,"So you do have an element of kids that are like, oh, there's some mayhem going on.",82
2303,There's some mayhem going on.,29
2304,Guess what?,11
2305,17-year-old boys like.,22
2306,They like mayhem.,17
2307,They like mosh pits.,20
2308,Right?,6
2309,You love that stuff.,20
2310,Yeah.,5
2311,That was my childhood.,22
2312,"If there was some mayhem, I wanted to find it.",46
2313,And that fuels these things.,28
2314,Normal boy behavior.,20
2315,"Normal boy behavior, especially when those boys are getting told, don't, don't, come on.",88
2316,Don't see this.,15
2317,And they're being locked up in houses right now with COVID.,59
2318,"They're, they're got freaking steam coming out of their ears.",61
2319,And then all of a sudden the cops are going to stand down while you smash windows and steal the shit and everybody can get free sneakers.,137
2320,Yes.,4
2321,That's nothing to do with George Floyd.,39
2322,It had so many things to do with so many different steps.,57
2323,Yeah.,5
2324,So many different factors that are collided together on that one day.,69
2325,Yeah.,5
2326,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's, man.",28
2327,"I don't know how this one lends up, man.",40
2328,I don't know how it ends up either.,35
2329,"It ends up me getting the fuck out of L.A. Gone, huh?",53
2330,"Oh, looks like it.",18
2331,Gone.,5
2332,Looks like it.,14
2333,"I don't, I don't see the benefit.",33
2334,"I want to come back and visit a lot, but it's just, it's just not, not the smart place.",87
2335,"Yeah, I'm, unfortunately, I'm rooted here unfortunately by the ocean.",69
2336,Yeah.,5
2337,Because I'm an ocean guy.,25
2338,And so there's really limited choices in the world.,51
2339,Yeah.,5
2340,It really is.,13
2341,That's a problem.,17
2342,"You know, they kind of got me.",30
2343,You're that connected to the ocean.,35
2344,"What is it about the ocean that you, you always post pictures of the sunrise and the ocean?",91
2345,"I don't think there's, you know, going surfing, just going, just going in the ocean.",84
2346,"And plus my, my life was kind of being in the SEAL teams was always, we always had that.",88
2347,"It was part of our life, you know, part of our life was the ocean growing up in the ocean.",90
2348,"Just there's some, I don't know, you know, I guess, I guess for me, it's a huge like nature thing, right?",105
2349,"You know, people, you should be, you should go outside.",55
2350,"Go outside and go hiking a mountain, you know, go, go to Montana and hike around, see what that feels like.",107
2351,"Go to, go to Idaho, check that out.",35
2352,"Go to the mountains, go to California mountains.",48
2353,You feel different.,19
2354,You feel different.,19
2355,You feel humbled.,17
2356,You feel small.,15
2357,You feel perspective.,21
2358,So the ocean does that for me.,30
2359,"And it's just mind clearing, right?",35
2360,You go out surfing like your mind is clear.,43
2361,It's kind of like your Jitsu.,29
2362,"Hey, you got to get out there.",30
2363,"You don't even know what you, sometimes you don't even, you know, you get done with a good role in Jitsu and you say, well, hey, you don't barely even remember it because your mind is just gone.",194
2364,You're just monkey mind.,24
2365,This is total zen state.,24
2366,Same thing with the being in the water from me surfing.,55
2367,"Same thing like, oh, I'm out here and my mind is just empty.",60
2368,It's monkey mind and I think that's really good for you.,56
2369,"Plus the fact it's humbling, plus the fact it's healthy.",56
2370,"So yeah, I just have a strong connection to the ocean.",54
2371,I know my son's a real water man.,33
2372,"You know, he's out.",19
2373,He serves all the time.,23
2374,I'd hate to do that to him and then my little daughter's getting her surfing on.,80
2375,"So yeah, it's just one of those things, man.",44
2376,"Yeah, I get it.",15
2377,There's a reason why surf towns like like towns that are near the ocean or chill.,81
2378,Like you get humbled by that.,29
2379,Like you take yourself seriously.,33
2380,"Look at that fucking body of water over there, stupid.",54
2381,"Yeah, you ain't shit.",21
2382,"You know, people say, well, it makes the seal team so good.",59
2383,And one of the major components is the ocean.,45
2384,Yeah.,5
2385,"Because when you've got to do an operation that involves the water, it just sucks.",82
2386,It just everything about it sucks.,34
2387,Everything about it sucks.,26
2388,"You're getting in a, you know, you're parachuting from a plane into the water.",78
2389,It's nighttime.,15
2390,"You got boat, there's freaking parachute like drifting around.",62
2391,You got to get your motor started.,34
2392,It's freezing cold.,19
2393,Boats flip over.,16
2394,Then you got to drive that boat to the beach and you got to drive through the surf zone.,88
2395,The weapons are covered with sand.,34
2396,You're freezing cold.,21
2397,It's just everything sucks.,27
2398,Everything sucks about it.,26
2399,"So when that's kind of your starting, and by the way, you haven't even conducted your operation yet.",100
2400,You haven't even started the operation.,39
2401,And you're freezing cold.,25
2402,You're tired.,13
2403,Your radio got flooded out.,27
2404,Your night vision goggles are freaking filled with sand.,56
2405,Everything sucks.,17
2406,And now you got to conduct your operation.,42
2407,"So in order to survive that way on a regular basis, that's one of the things that makes the seal teams good is where we're used to this one additional component.",161
2408,All the time that you always have to deal with.,47
2409,You have to figure that out.,28
2410,You have to be able to gut through it.,38
2411,"That's why in basic seal training, they just put you in the water for a long time.",82
2412,They just put you in there.,27
2413,We have to develop an attitude that embraces the suck.,54
2414,Oh yeah.,8
2415,Yeah.,5
2416,For sure.,9
2417,"You actually enjoy it in some way, some crazy way that you know it sucks.",73
2418,"Like that video that I always quote, your video good.",53
2419,"Dude, I listened to that in my head all the time.",49
2420,And I watched the video a ton of times and listened to it.,58
2421,I played it on this podcast at least four times.,48
2422,But I hear it when I'm training.,32
2423,"Like if I'm running hills and I'm fucking exhausted and there's like another hundred yards to get to the top of that hill, I hear good.",135
2424,Good.,5
2425,Good.,5
2426,You're exhausted.,17
2427,It means you're fucking doing it.,33
2428,Good.,5
2429,"Well, suck it up.",17
2430,What's your choice?,19
2431,What else are you going to think about?,39
2432,Cry.,4
2433,"You know, cry, curl up in a ball.",33
2434,I can't do it.,14
2435,"No, it's like, no, actually good.",33
2436,Bring it.,9
2437,Let's make this happen.,23
2438,Yeah.,5
2439,I'm going to do that in the sauna when I'm exhausted in the sauna.,66
2440,And it's like 190 degrees.,26
2441,And I'm 19 minutes in and I'm doing a 30 minute session.,56
2442,"I'm like, good.",15
2443,Good.,5
2444,Sucks.,6
2445,It means it's going to have a great effect on your body.,56
2446,You're going to get that whor medic effect.,43
2447,"This is how you get the heat shock proteins, pussy.",51
2448,Hang in there.,14
2449,Good.,5
2450,"If you want to do something that's worthwhile, it's going to suck.",66
2451,It's just going to suck.,24
2452,And you might as well just enjoy that part of it.,49
2453,Yes.,4
2454,Yeah.,5
2455,I mock myself too.,18
2456,It's everything I do.,21
2457,"Oh, you make fun of yourself.",29
2458,"Oh, all the time.",17
2459,Yeah.,5
2460,I get pissed at that little part of my brain.,45
2461,"I'm like, oh, really?",21
2462,You think you're going to listen to you?,40
2463,Yeah.,5
2464,Not happening.,14
2465,Not happening.,14
2466,I put these things in the kids books.,37
2467,You know what I mean?,21
2468,Put those things in the kids books.,35
2469,Like there's one of the kids books talks about this hail horrible hill.,71
2470,"You know, like this is what you're going to face horrible hill.",63
2471,And what are you going to do?,29
2472,"You know, it's going to suck.",29
2473,Just got to do it.,18
2474,Yeah.,5
2475,You just do it.,15
2476,"But the thing is, it's always sucks while it's happening.",57
2477,It's always fucking horrible.,29
2478,"But then when it's over, it feels great that you got through the suck.",70
2479,"And I don't think most people who don't experience suck, they don't experience that feeling of conquering suck.",111
2480,Yeah.,5
2481,And that's the important thing to try and remember.,51
2482,Yeah.,5
2483,Right?,6
2484,So you remember it.,19
2485,I remember it.,14
2486,I remember what that feels.,27
2487,"So even when it's sucking, I'm like, I know how this is going to feel.",70
2488,I know how this plays out.,26
2489,And you know what?,18
2490,"Actually, I know other feeling, you know, is when you don't do it.",66
2491,Yeah.,5
2492,"And the end of the day comes, you're like, dude, that was pathetic.",67
2493,"You didn't even, you know, you, and that's just the worst feeling.",66
2494,That's the feeling that really makes you sick.,46
2495,"And so between that carrot and stick, carrot being like, I know this is going to be good and stick being, I know at the end of the day, if I'm putting my head on the pillow, and I was a bitch, that doesn't feel good.",216
2496,I don't want none of that.,26
2497,It's the worst feeling of all time.,35
2498,It's being disappointed in yourself.,36
2499,"Well, it's also when you're a type of person that wants to achieve, and so you're always trying to get things done, you're always trying to push yourself.",154
2500,"When you fall short because of cowardice, or because it is the worst feeling that, or just, just failure, any kind of failure, the reason why you, one of the reasons why, I mean, at least I can speak for myself personally, I do think so hard is because I've felt that sting of failure.",285
2501,"You need to know what that feels like, especially when you quit.",64
2502,"You need to know what, yeah, see, that's it.",44
2503,"You need to know when you're on, and you need to hear that, that fucking sting, feel that sting so that when it comes up again, you're like, not today, bitch, not today.",169
2504,I've been here before.,22
2505,"Keep going, keep going, find a way, but there's something about good.",69
2506,"It's just even saying it, it makes me smile.",44
2507,"Really does, it works, it really does work, because it's an attitude changer, and I use the song, the song is really easy, it's not that bad, it's just fucking 30 minutes, you just deal with it.",194
2508,"But there's something about those last 11 minutes that you can get in your head like, fuck, I mean, really, I probably get the good effects if I just sleep now.",160
2509,"There's like all these little mind games you play, but if you just say good, was it suck?",89
2510,Good.,5
2511,I start smiling.,16
2512,You can rationalize a lot of that.,34
2513,You can start rationalizing of why.,35
2514,"Well, these last four minutes won't really make that big of a difference.",73
2515,A shift in perception.,22
2516,I always notice that from listening to music when I run.,56
2517,"There's something about listening to a great fucking song, when a great song kicks on, when you're running, like if I'm running in Ted Nuget's Stranglehold, it comes on.",169
2518,"There's something about Stranglehold, because it also has a double meaning, right?",82
2519,"It's jujitsu, it's Stranglehold.",32
2520,"You know, you're like, so when you hear that, here I come again now, baby.",74
2521,I can run.,10
2522,I can run.,10
2523,I can get extra energy.,23
2524,"I'm like, where the fuck is that energy coming from?",52
2525,"Well, it's coming from my mind, right?",38
2526,The music stimulates my mind.,29
2527,It kicks in those endorphins.,29
2528,"And then all of a sudden, I got an extra gear.",46
2529,"Well, how come I can't just conjure up that fucking extra gear?",63
2530,I think you can.,16
2531,You can't.,10
2532,You got to figure out how to do that all the time.,50
2533,"Yeah, that always is horrible to see like, you know, in a fight when a guy, either he loses a fight.",100
2534,"And after he loses the fight, he's raging.",42
2535,"He's all mad, but he was just gassed.",37
2536,Right.,6
2537,He was just gassed.,19
2538,Right.,6
2539,Where was that?,15
2540,Where was that right there?,27
2541,Two and a half minutes ago.,27
2542,"Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's just overcoming anxiety for fight or sometimes it's just that when it's over and the plug is pulled, you know, it's over and they're like, fuck!",173
2543,Yeah.,5
2544,And then they're angry and raging because they realized they failed.,68
2545,They didn't manage their energy correctly.,42
2546,They didn't manage their mind.,30
2547,They're anxiety.,16
2548,"Yeah, exactly.",14
2549,I'm feeling a fucking loser.,28
2550,"Ah, fucking loser.",18
2551,"I'm so hard on myself, man.",27
2552,"Everything I've ever done wrong, everything I've ever said wrong, just everything.",82
2553,"Just say, I'll be in the middle of working out sometimes and I'll think about and go, fuck!",91
2554,But that is also that hard-natured.,35
2555,That's what makes yourself.,27
2556,Yeah.,5
2557,And that keeps you going.,25
2558,That makes you achieve.,23
2559,It's like people think that it's easy to just kind of go out there and get things done.,87
2560,But it's not.,13
2561,That's why most people don't do it.,35
2562,"Yeah, you know, so I don't sleep a lot, right?",46
2563,"And some of my people are like, and look, I'm not saying you shouldn't sleep a lot.",83
2564,Everyone should sleep as much as they can.,42
2565,I don't sleep a lot.,20
2566,"People are like, hey, no, why don't you sleep more?",51
2567,"And I'm like, bro, I wish I could.",34
2568,"I wish there wasn't this little thing in the back of my head going, hey, hey, you know, you're actually that you could be doing a lot more right now.",149
2569,What about this?,16
2570,What about that?,16
2571,What about the other thing?,27
2572,"Like, that's what's going on in my head.",40
2573,"That's going, gee, I have to get up.",36
2574,"Like, no, there's a thing in there going, you better get up.",60
2575,You better get up.,18
2576,They're tracking on you.,24
2577,They're watching you.,21
2578,You better get up.,18
2579,It's happening.,15
2580,There's a bad guy out there.,28
2581,He's training harder.,21
2582,Like that's what's in my head.,30
2583,"It's not in my head like, oh, no.",33
2584,"Hey, please let the freaking, let the freaking powers of the world allow me to go into bed at night and just pass out and be like, oh, I'm good.",144
2585,I'm satisfied with my life right now.,37
2586,I wish I could feel that for freaking eight hours a night.,58
2587,It ain't there.,15
2588,It ain't there.,15
2589,"It's like, oh, people talk about staying hungry.",48
2590,I've been starving.,19
2591,I'm starving.,13
2592,All the time.,13
2593,All the time.,13
2594,"Like, stay hungry.",18
2595,"Yeah, you have to like, yeah, I know.",37
2596,It's different ends.,20
2597,It doesn't end.,15
2598,That's the thing.,17
2599,"As soon as I get somewhere, as soon as I get somewhere, I'm like, oh, where else?",81
2600,I need to go.,13
2601,I need to go somewhere else.,28
2602,"Yeah, no worry about getting soft.",34
2603,Yeah.,5
2604,"Yeah, always.",13
2605,"No matter what I've ever done, if I was like, one day, there'll be a thing where I'll become satisfied and calm.",112
2606,"No, with everything that's good that comes, now there's an equal fear of becoming a pussy.",90
2607,"There's a fear of now becoming lazy and becoming like second rate and just like, god damn it.",93
2608,There's no end.,15
2609,Yeah.,5
2610,"No, so now I don't even think there's an end.",45
2611,"No, there's definitely not an end.",34
2612,"That's what's funny about shooting the bow, right?",50
2613,Is what I find funny about shooting the bow is anger aggression really doesn't help you.,88
2614,At all.,7
2615,"Yeah, at all.",13
2616,"You know, it fucks you up on.",29
2617,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying.",29
2618,Because anger and aggression is all fast twitch shit too.,57
2619,It's all movement.,18
2620,"Whereas the bow is like, you got to have the mind of no mind.",61
2621,You got to just execute and just stay completely focused on the task.,69
2622,Totally detached from what's happening.,39
2623,Yeah.,5
2624,And he's got to sit there and let that deal.,44
2625,"Oh, it's totally a new skill.",29
2626,"And for me, like, the competition that I experienced, I only, the only competition I had other than inside the gym, you know, training partners is fighting and that's all fast stuff.",182
2627,It's all like explosions and movement.,38
2628,"So anytime where there's danger and anxiety and fear, your body's geared up to go quick and move quick, but with hunting, it's the opposite when you're drawing back on an animal, all that anxiety, like you better get that quick out of your head.",245
2629,Yeah.,5
2630,"Yeah, there's no quick.",23
2631,There's execute and calmness.,29
2632,Stay in the zone.,17
2633,Nothing exists other than the process of executing the perfect shot.,68
2634,It's the same thing with shooting.,34
2635,"You know, you have you draw fast.",33
2636,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",23
2637,"You move fast, you draw fast.",29
2638,"And then as soon as you punch out that weapon, you got to go boom.",66
2639,"And like, you just got to let that thing go.",44
2640,Yes.,4
2641,"You see guys, myself included, like you ever shot headplates before?",68
2642,Yes.,4
2643,"And you know, there's six headplates.",37
2644,"You'd see me or someone else, they miss one and if they don't let that go, then everything falls apart.",103
2645,The wheels fall off.,20
2646,"If they miss one and then they try and shoot, usually I would just miss one and just keep shooting.",99
2647,Like it didn't even happen.,27
2648,Maybe go back and get it where you kind of have to go back and get it.,70
2649,"But if you go, how did I miss that?",35
2650,It was just a total and complete and utter disaster.,52
2651,There was a great video that Tim Kennedy put off of him shooting on the range.,78
2652,"And you know, he puts dummy rounds in with his regular rounds and he hits the dummy round and click and he's like, look at that trigger control.",144
2653,Trigger discipline because like there was no flinch.,52
2654,There was no nothing.,21
2655,It was just click.,18
2656,There's no movement.,20
2657,It was perfect.,15
2658,"You know, which is what you're trying to achieve.",49
2659,What you're trying to achieve?,30
2660,"You're trying, you know, the last thing you want to see is click.",65
2661,You look weird fucking.,23
2662,Remember when I first started shooting rifles?,46
2663,Like that's what I would experience.,36
2664,That thing we were anticipating.,32
2665,"The 30 win mag, 300 win mag.",28
2666,So it's got a lot of kick to it.,32
2667,"You know, it's a boom.",22
2668,It's like a loud kicking gun.,29
2669,So there was no round in the chamber.,37
2670,"And I saw myself doing them like, you bitch.",44
2671,Like you better learn how to stop doing that.,45
2672,One thing that's interesting is learning how to shoot a bow radically increase my accuracy with a rifle radically because it's so still.,136
2673,"There's so much stillness and everything's freehand, right?",59
2674,You're very rarely shooting a rifle at an animal freehand.,58
2675,You're usually trying to find a rest.,37
2676,"Unless it's like inside of, you know, 60, 70 yards, you're probably going to try to rest.",89
2677,"You're not going to shoot a 300 yard shot with a rifle freehand, but with a bow, everything's freehand.",103
2678,"So with a rifle, I just knew that all it was, just squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, let it go off.",92
2679,"Just let it go off, squeeze, squeeze, boom.",43
2680,"Like when I started shooting at a Terrentactical shooting on the range, the easiest thing for me was a rifle.",109
2681,"I was like, oh, God, all I have to do is just squeeze and the trigger will go off.",82
2682,I'm so used to a bow where there's so many moving parts and you're using your back and you let it go off a surprise shot.,121
2683,It made a big difference in my rifle accuracy.,46
2684,Yeah.,5
2685,That was when Dudley was teaching me how to shoot.,50
2686,And Andy was there too.,23
2687,So Andy was like translating for me.,36
2688,"He's like, hey, what do you mean?",33
2689,He's translating it to seal pistol shooting and they're kind of like communicating to each other.,97
2690,"And then Andy said, hey, what are you saying is like, you know, frontside focus.",80
2691,"I was like, okay, cool, got it.",31
2692,And that was awesome to have freaking Dudley.,45
2693,I know.,7
2694,"The first person that ever shows me anything about archery is Dudley saying, hey, here's the bow and here's exactly how to shoot.",129
2695,You idiot.,10
2696,"And I'm like, thank you.",24
2697,That's pretty goddamn lucky.,28
2698,"Yeah, I mean, we're both real lucky in that regard.",51
2699,I learned how to bow hunt from camhains and John Dudley.,56
2700,"Like, geez.",11
2701,It's pretty lucky.,18
2702,Those are like the world champions.,35
2703,"Yeah, yeah, that's Jordan and Kobe Bryant or Jordan and LeBron James.",69
2704,Completely.,11
2705,"Yeah, 100%.",11
2706,Yeah.,5
2707,We're very fortunate.,21
2708,"And there's something about hunting too that once you, it seems like when you're looking out on the surface, it seems so straightforward.",137
2709,"And then once you start doing it, it's very much like martial arts.",67
2710,"Well, you're like, god damn, there's a lot of layers to this shit.",66
2711,"There's so many layers, you know, and then when you're hanging out with a guy like cam or a guy like Dudley and you hunt with them and you see them hunt, you go, oh, like this is, I get it.",189
2712,This is a black belt.,21
2713,"Oh, yeah.",9
2714,This is some Mundiales champion here.,37
2715,"Oh, yeah.",9
2716,"Yeah, it's exactly what it is.",30
2717,"It's so, so crazy.",18
2718,Yeah.,5
2719,It's so crazy to see those guys in action and just to be like listening to what Dudley's telling me about what a freaking elk is going to do.,141
2720,Yeah.,5
2721,He's got to come over here.,27
2722,Yeah.,5
2723,"I'm like, well, I guess that's just about to happen.",52
2724,"Oh, and it just happened.",25
2725,Yeah.,5
2726,"Well, it's madness.",19
2727,"And then what Dudley too is like, he's so into cooking it too.",62
2728,He's so good at cooking.,24
2729,It's like you get the whole lifestyle thing from him.,53
2730,"You get like this learning how the art of archery, which really is an art form.",79
2731,"It's an art form, just like martial arts are.",45
2732,And then this moment of keeping your shit together and the execution of a shot and then the big payoff when that does happen and then the harvesting the animal carrying it out and then the meal.,194
2733,"That meal afterwards when you've had a successful hunting trip, it's like, god damn, we're in camp in Utah and Dudley made that neck, that neck roast with, with jalapenos, and the bell peppers and the holy shit that was good.",225
2734,But it was also so good because you knew what went down.,56
2735,"You know, you were there when he shot the elk.",46
2736,It's all so crazy.,18
2737,It's so satisfying that I can't imagine it not being a part of my life and not being a part of my diet.,103
2738,It just changes you.,20
2739,So it's too bad that it's not more available to people.,55
2740,Yeah.,5
2741,"Yeah, it's not.",15
2742,It's hard.,10
2743,There's a high bar for accessibility.,37
2744,"It's very, and we got real lucky.",33
2745,"Oh, for sure.",13
2746,"We get to hunt at the desert ranch in Utah, which is this incredible place.",75
2747,It's a private property.,24
2748,It's all wild animals.,22
2749,"There's no fences, but it's private property.",45
2750,So there's not an overwhelming number of people.,48
2751,Like there's a lot of guys that they try to go on a public land and unless you're willing to hike in 20 miles and there's a lot of guys that are willing now to hike in 20 miles because there's now this culture of these really fit backpack hunters like these Aaron Snyder type dudes who put these fucking heavy packs on and they just go.,336
2752,They're training for this moment all year round.,48
2753,"Like Aaron has this crazy setup in his gym where he has this elevated treadmill and then each, the treadmill on each side has a like a, like an Olympic bar and you lift the bar so you're holding weight and you're going up this elevated treadmill.",246
2754,"I'm like, Jesus, fucking Christ man.",36
2755,But that's what you have to do if you want to be mountain fit to be able to do that.,84
2756,And that's the barrier for entry to go and do these public land hunts.,70
2757,Everybody stops at the trailhead.,33
2758,Everybody gets out of their car and then how far are you going to go?,69
2759,Because he's willing to go 20 fucking miles in.,47
2760,Are you willing to go 20 miles in?,34
2761,Yeah.,5
2762,That's going to take eight hours and then come 20 miles back out with a moose on your back.,91
2763,That's like that's the totally legit.,37
2764,Totally legit.,14
2765,That's as legit as it gets.,27
2766,Yeah.,5
2767,And most of those guys all had to learn themselves.,51
2768,"They ought to teach themselves and you know, they've all, you know, we're real lucky that like we get this amazing coaching.",124
2769,"So we're getting these, even though there's so many layers to it and we're both kind, I mean, I've been doing it now.",117
2770,"I've been hunting for eight years, bow hunting for, I guess six, six ish, total rookie.",87
2771,"You know, I'm still like a blue belt or maybe, maybe I'm like getting ready to be a purple belt.",96
2772,Maybe I might get my purple belt soon.,38
2773,"But you know, you go out with those guys.",41
2774,They're fucking 10 degree black belts.,38
2775,"And it's like there's, even though there's, you know, there's this barrier for entry, it is still possible.",107
2776,It's still possible.,20
2777,But it's just like jujitsu.,27
2778,"It's like when you, when you're talking to that blue belt, you're like, keep fucking going.",91
2779,Yeah.,5
2780,And you can make it.,20
2781,You can do this.,16
2782,I have to at least bring this up a little bit to clarify a little bit.,70
2783,What I did to John Dudley on the jujitsu mats.,46
2784,You broke his neck.,19
2785,You broke his fucking neck.,27
2786,There's Amy what you did.,25
2787,"Here's the only part that you're missing, missing a little bit, right?",70
2788,"So I'm giving him his wife, like a jujitsu private.",51
2789,"So you broke his neck and his, Andy's there.",44
2790,Andy's there.,13
2791,Andy's there.,13
2792,Little dud was there.,21
2793,"So it was like, it's getting worse.",35
2794,I think your friend was a wife and his son.,43
2795,"So I'm just completely, you know, I'm chilling and okay, this is this, this is that.",84
2796,"And I'm not even, I'm not even doing it.",40
2797,"Like this is that we, in one weekend, Andy, John and me, we did, we did archery, which I had never done before.",111
2798,"Then we did jujitsu, which John had never done before.",54
2799,"And then we went on the wind tunnel, which John had never done before.",70
2800,"You know, because Andy's like a sky god, parachuting, blah, blah, blah.",71
2801,And so we did those three things.,33
2802,It was kind of like a cool weekend.,35
2803,"I mean, that's kind of an epic weekend, really?",47
2804,Pretty good.,12
2805,Let's be honest.,16
2806,So it's jujitsu time.,21
2807,"So I'm like, okay, cool.",24
2808,"So I'm going over, hey, this is the guard.",42
2809,This is the mount.,18
2810,I'm going over all the basic stuff.,35
2811,"I'm, I'm, I'm just giving the basic overall kind of concepts.",61
2812,"So I get done with that, you know?",34
2813,And I'm done.,13
2814,Like I'm done.,14
2815,"I'm, I'm just done.",19
2816,"I'm like, okay, you know, great.",32
2817,It's good introduction.,23
2818,"And then Dudley is like, well, let's go a little bit.",53
2819,"And I'm like, does the wrong language?",38
2820,I would have pulled them aside.,31
2821,Come here.,10
2822,"So, so he's like, let's go a little bit.",40
2823,"And even that, you know what?",29
2824,I'm totally cool with that.,27
2825,"Of course, he wasn't, I, he wasn't mean.",40
2826,And he wasn't thinking he was going to be.,42
2827,That wasn't it.,15
2828,He wants to experience it.,26
2829,"Yeah, I shouldn't have even said let's go a little bit.",55
2830,"He was like, he was like, hey, can we, can we try it?",53
2831,You know something like that?,29
2832,Just being cool.,16
2833,"And I'm like, absolutely, man, no problem.",42
2834,"So, so I lay down on the ground, right?",39
2835,"And I'm like, he says, well, what should I do?",46
2836,"I go, you know, just attack me.",31
2837,"So, I lay down on my back.",26
2838,"I'm like, just attack me.",25
2839,And guess what he did?,22
2840,What he did.,12
2841,He freaking attacked me.,24
2842,He like came at me.,19
2843,"And Doug, he's a big, strong athletic guy.",42
2844,"He's six, what is he?",21
2845,"Six, five?",10
2846,At least.,9
2847,Yeah.,5
2848,"So, he come, he fuck, he grabs, and I'm chilling.",49
2849,"You know, I'm just like, okay, cool.",36
2850,He comes at me.,15
2851,"I think I, he like grabbed me.",30
2852,And so I kind of replace guard.,31
2853,"And then I sweep him and I'm, and so I'm mounted.",49
2854,And all this is just pretty chill.,34
2855,"And I put in a, a Z-Kill choke, right?",38
2856,"Which I have a little, yeah, no G is equal choke.",49
2857,"I have a little, I have a little good technique for doing it, but no big deal.",78
2858,So I put in the a Z-Kill choke.,31
2859,"He's, this is the thing that I really wish I should have explained more because we hadn't rolled.",97
2860,"I wasn't like, hey, when you start to feel like you got a, you got to tap out, right?",85
2861,"He knew to tap out, but I kind of figured everyone knows how to tap out.",72
2862,"So I put the choke in on him, right?",36
2863,"Well, he doesn't know what to do.",33
2864,"So he, he's grabbing me and he's pulling, he's squeezing me.",60
2865,So he's on the bottom.,22
2866,"I mounted, I've got the Z-Kill choke in.",40
2867,"And in order to defend himself and his own mind, he's squeezing me into him.",76
2868,"Which the way I do my Z-Kill choke, it hurts.",45
2869,"I mean, it compresses the choke even more.",42
2870,"And so what are you doing, specifically?",40
2871,"Basically I put my hand, I make a fist and I put my fist in my sternum.",71
2872,"And then I, you know, grab the form here and then arch my shoulder so there's the neck right here.",98
2873,"It closes it, right?",20
2874,So it's closed.,15
2875,"So you're putting the fist into the, right, it's a, it's a, it's a trake.",73
2876,It's an air choke.,18
2877,It's gnarly.,12
2878,Okay.,5
2879,"And so I'm just doing this and you can see that hole and you shrug, but as I'm doing this, he's panicking and pulling me into him.",130
2880,Oh Jesus.,9
2881,And he only did it for a second and then he tapped out.,55
2882,"And I was like, yeah, you know, I wasn't, I was just like, oh, you know, boom.",78
2883,And then he taps.,17
2884,"And then the rest of the story is, I guess I didn't know a lot about the rest of the story.",91
2885,I didn't know any of the rest of the story.,43
2886,"Cause he didn't want to see, he's like a baby.",46
2887,"Yeah, fractured like his high white bone and then it built calcium up around it.",80
2888,"So he calls up Andy one day and he goes, dude, I think I got throat cancer cause there's something growing in my throat.",120
2889,"And he goes, the doctor gets an ectra and he's like, hey, did you do something to your neck?",92
2890,"Because there's a, there's a hairline fracture that's not now calcium deposit around it.",88
2891,"And he's like, oh, I know what happened.",40
2892,"So I guess in my defense, why did you just get him in like a head and arm too?",78
2893,"It wasn't that, it wasn't like a big deal.",42
2894,"It wasn't, it wasn't crazy.",27
2895,It wasn't crazy.,16
2896,It was just normal.,19
2897,"It'd be like, if you grabbed somebody that showed up here is like, hey, you know, like can you roll with me?",108
2898,"You'd be like, oh, cool.",24
2899,And you'd put him in a kind of whatever presented.,50
2900,"It's all maybe arm-ocum, maybe you'd do a commitment.",53
2901,"The problem is when you get used to doing certain types of chokes and then you're doing it to someone who doesn't, especially that where you got a fist in a neck.",162
2902,"And I, this is, I guess this is the only thing.",47
2903,Make no mistake about it.,25
2904,"Even though I was just chilling, he was not.",44
2905,"He was going level seven, berserk or moat, I'll be.",51
2906,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",19
2907,"He's such a good athlete, you know?",35
2908,There's a thing about people that have never done jujitsu when they're doing it with someone who's a black belt.,112
2909,They probably feel like they can just kind of go crazy and you'll just absorb it and deal with it.,98
2910,And so they just try it.,24
2911,Let's see what happens when I go crazy.,39
2912,So now he holds this over my head.,34
2913,"You know, he should.",20
2914,He broke his neck.,18
2915,Yeah.,5
2916,"Oh, I know, I know.",19
2917,"One day I'm like, I'm like, we're up in Montana.",48
2918,"And I said, hey, man, he's like, he sits like, he was at my house, he's like, oh, thanks for having us over.",108
2919,"I go, bro, you, you, you, you, you, you taught me how to do this.",65
2920,"You brought me up here, you take me hunting, like you're doing all this awesome stuff, man.",91
2921,"I, you know, you're the man, dude, I really appreciate it.",58
2922,"He goes, yeah, and you know what you did for me?",48
2923,"I'm like, what?",15
2924,"He goes, broke my neck.",23
2925,"It's awful, bro.",16
2926,"It's all good now, though, right?",33
2927,"Oh, yeah.",9
2928,So I'm bothering him anymore.,29
2929,"Oh, I don't know about that.",28
2930,I thought you meant it's all good between us.,45
2931,It's all good between us.,25
2932,"You just said we do, bro, we're freaking.",41
2933,I think every time he swallows and thinks about you.,52
2934,"No, he coughs.",14
2935,"Oh, no, he coughs.",18
2936,"Hopefully, I mean, I haven't talked to him about it.",52
2937,I don't like to break it up a lot.,34
2938,But...,6
2939,So there's something in there that's fucking where there's throat.,66
2940,Something that's making him cough.,34
2941,So they'd have to probably get in there and scrape it.,54
2942,"So while we're hunting, he would be like, and then he'd look at me.",67
2943,"Oh, no.",7
2944,And I'm just thinking of such a horrible person.,48
2945,"Oh, no.",7
2946,"And it's, you know, I always say like, you know, I've been a Dean Lister, I've been Dean Lister's training partner for 20 something years.",138
2947,"Up until recently, he never hurt me and I never hurt him.",57
2948,Never.,6
2949,"I mean, Yeah, because he ended up hurting me.",45
2950,And he ended up hurting me in the dumbest possible way.,55
2951,I show up to class.,19
2952,"This was like, this is over a year ago, because I hurt my archery for a while.",78
2953,"I show up to class late, right?",31
2954,"And he's teaching and we're just gonna roll, but I come out and he's like finishing the class.",94
2955,And I'm cold and I'm just getting on the mat.,45
2956,"And he says, oh, let me show something.",39
2957,"He goes here, lay down.",23
2958,And he gets a...,16
2959,"He gets a straight, like he gets an Americana on me or a Camira, but anyways, he's like, hey, try and get out by straightening your arm.",136
2960,And the whole class is watching.,32
2961,"He goes, try and get out by straightening your arm.",51
2962,"And I go, okay, cool.",21
2963,"And so he puts me across, he gets across side, he puts the, I think it was, I think it was an action of Camira.",111
2964,"He says, he says, all right, now try, and this isn't running class.",67
2965,"He goes, try.",13
2966,So he's like straight arm Camira.,33
2967,"He's about to straight, he's about, my arm is here and he's about to straight.",78
2968,"He wants me to try and get out by like doing almost like a hitchhiker, skateboard or something.",95
2969,"So he says, he says, try and get out by straightening your arm.",63
2970,"I go, okay, I straight my arm and he just, in a millisecond, and you could hear it.",83
2971,"Arm locks me, totally destroyed my arm.",39
2972,"No, not totally.",16
2973,It was injured very bad.,24
2974,The first time in my life I had to get a sling.,47
2975,"This bro, this guy comes over to me, Dean Lister, and he goes, bro, and he's such a nice guy.",93
2976,"He's, oh, bro, I'm so sorry.",28
2977,"And he goes, I didn't know your elbow wasn't very flexible.",59
2978,"I go, bro, it's an elbow.",25
2979,Elbows aren't flexible.,23
2980,"They're bone, dude.",19
2981,I didn't know your elbow wasn't flexible.,41
2982,Ugh.,4
2983,"Dean needs a DNA test, because I know he's at least 86% in the end of the tall.",79
2984,"Yeah, at a minimum.",19
2985,"The way his neck and shoulders move together, like you can see that dude with like a big club.",94
2986,For sure.,9
2987,"And a total, total mutant and a savant on the Jiu Jitsu mats.",61
2988,A complete savant on the Jiu Jitsu mats.,40
2989,"Well, he's literally the missing link.",38
2990,"He's the link, I shouldn't say the missing link, the link to Jiu Jitsu expanding into the leglock.",98
2991,Modern Jiu Jitsu.,17
2992,It's 100%.,10
2993,Dean Lister.,12
2994,100%.,5
2995,"And the statement that he made to John Danaheer has become world famous, because Danaheer set it on my podcast.",111
2996,"He said, Dean Lister said to him, why would you ignore 50% of the human body?",77
2997,"And Danaheer being the fucking genius that he is, was like, why would you enjoy it?",83
2998,Yeah.,5
2999,Why would you?,14
3000,"Most of the, like, you know, all these new things that are coming out now, right?",81
3001,Yeah.,5
3002,"You know, you see Gordon Ryan just insane.",42
3003,All these guys that are really attacking legs now.,50
3004,"And by the way, just like Dean, Gordon's not only good at attacking legs.",73
3005,He's good at everything.,24
3006,"But I was asking Dean, because I watched, you know, Dean's done all these moves to me for years, you know?",106
3007,"And just over and over again, right?",36
3008,This is what we do.,19
3009,This is what we've been doing.,30
3010,"We've been doing it since he won ADCC when, when Eddie beat, well, they're when Dean won, when he beat Kakaraco in the finals with what they now call 50-50, which he and I called Kakaraco.",188
3011,"After that, we called that Kakaraco.",36
3012,"No one started doing it for another many, many, probably 10 years regularly.",76
3013,"I was there there, yeah.",24
3014,"Oh, yeah.",9
3015,And I wasn't there that year.,29
3016,"I was, I was there when Eddie won in San Diego.",47
3017,"We were all, I competed in San Diego, Dean competed in San Diego and Eddie competed in San Diego for the trials.",112
3018,I was there for that too.,25
3019,Eddie won.,10
3020,Yeah.,5
3021,Dean won.,9
3022,I lost two big country Roy Nelson.,34
3023,"Oh, wow.",8
3024,"Yeah, yeah.",11
3025,And I did because I wasn't very tactically smart.,49
3026,"I scrambled to position and I tried to get a, I, as a matter of fact, I got a crucifix, because that was kind of one of my go-to moves, get a crucifix and I get a choke from there.",180
3027,"When I should have taken the back and gotten points, and I didn't, and Roy Nelson, who is a great guy and he's a total stud, he, I got the crucifix position and he like powered out of bounds.",191
3028,"And so then, and he beat me because he's a much better wrestler than me.",72
3029,And I'll smash your jutsu too.,30
3030,"Anyways, when he won that, like we were doing this stuff.",57
3031,"So anyways, right, like probably six months ago, or three months ago, I was asking, Dean, I said, hey, Dean, are you starting to see things that you didn't know?",161
3032,"When you're watching, because he watches, you know what I said, are you starting to see jutsu things that you didn't know?",122
3033,"Like, footlock stuff.",21
3034,"And he's like, yeah, about three or four months ago, I started seeing some things that I didn't think of.",105
3035,"So that's how long it took people to get to and then start to develop their own stuff, which is pretty crazy.",109
3036,"Well, it's fascinating that once the game moved into this sort of leglock heavy style that so many guys like Craig Jones and Gordon Ryan and this, you know, Gary Tonin, there's so many of those guys that you're seeing this game getting tighter and tighter with leg locks.",271
3037,Yeah.,5
3038,And John Donnerer examines everything too.,42
3039,Because Donnerer's body is broken.,34
3040,He can't really compete anymore.,32
3041,"I mean, he has an artificial hip.",33
3042,He's got an artificial knee.,28
3043,His body's really fucked up.,28
3044,And his other knee is really unstable.,38
3045,"So he can roll, but he can only roll very controlled with guys who understand his physical limitations and then you can see how he understands positions.",153
3046,You can get a lot out of rolling with him.,42
3047,There's a great video actually of Gordon Ryan rolling with John Donnerer.,73
3048,And obviously they're not using strength.,41
3049,They're just flow rolling.,26
3050,But you see how tactical he is and how ahead of every position he is and how his deep understanding of it.,106
3051,And part of it is because he's teaching these guys and he's teaching them from a position where he can't really do it himself.,126
3052,"He can do it, he can't compete.",31
3053,He can't roll.,14
3054,"Right, right.",13
3055,But he has the mind for it.,27
3056,So he's seeing it from the outside.,35
3057,And he's also this fucking really genius human being.,53
3058,So he's able to break this down and then he has this core group of bad asses that understand what a great pleasure it is to have this genius teach you.,151
3059,"I mean, it's not a coincidence that that whole Hanzo Gracie team has become one of the biggest threats.",103
3060,Like that whole team has filled with fucking murderers.,55
3061,"Yeah, and they're just to again emphasize the point is leg locks are a part of the game.",88
3062,And there was a time period where people thought that leg locks would change the game completely.,97
3063,"And at a certain point, the defenses for the leg locks become known.",68
3064,And all of a sudden you have to go back to the other parts of Jiu-Jitsu.,72
3065,"And that's why you see guys like Tonin, right?",46
3066,"He doesn't always win with heel hooks, but you have to address them or you will lose.",85
3067,"And yeah, those guys, it's really cool to see those guys coming up.",67
3068,"I mean, I should not know why I'm kind of saying it coming up like I'm like there.",82
3069,"But I'm watching this development come, which I was at kind of ground zero with Dean Lister.",92
3070,"And the crazy thing is Dean Lister, he has like a crazy, so-vont mind where I would create one thing for every, whatever, for every 20 things that Dean created.",160
3071,"It's probably like Eddie, and I don't know Eddie as well as you do, but just the creative part of his brain is what the most powerful thing was.",144
3072,"And then once people saw it, they're like, okay, now we can build upon this.",76
3073,"Yeah, for Eddie, it's 100% the creative part of his brain.",58
3074,"Also the fact that when I met Eddie, he hated lifting weights, he wouldn't lift weights.",88
3075,Because I would try to get him to lift weights.,47
3076,"Like, come on, let's lift weights.",34
3077,"I'm gonna fuck him, lift his shit, you can go lift weights.",59
3078,"So he was this little tiny guy and he had to rely on technique, so he had to rely on trickery.",94
3079,"Plus he was a musician, right?",30
3080,"So he's always this creative guy, and he smoked a lot of weed too.",66
3081,So he was always thinking about things outside the box.,55
3082,And he's also this guy that doesn't like people telling him he's wrong.,71
3083,"So like, you can't do it that way, he's like, oh really?",56
3084,Let's see if I can.,19
3085,And then he would find a way to do it.,38
3086,And he just developed all these weird entries into things and these weird setups that people didn't see coming.,111
3087,"And once he sort of improved upon these and then started expanding upon them and then developing that whole 10th planet system, I mean, really, it's insanely creative system that's just developed based on his ability to just think outside the box.",247
3088,I had Jeff Glover at my training and my dream for a long time.,62
3089,I'm teaching another one.,25
3090,"He's the same thing where he's small, he's crazy flexible, he smokes a lot of weed.",83
3091,"And like he would just do wild things, wild things.",51
3092,"I was at, I was at, actually at ADCC.",37
3093,And I was with my son was probably like nine or something.,58
3094,"And we're there watching, and Jeff Glover's about to compete.",61
3095,This was before I really was friends with Jeff.,47
3096,What was he doing at Donkey Guard thing back then?,50
3097,He was doing everything.,24
3098,"He, the Donkey Guard hadn't become super popular, but he was kind of in the beginning stages of it.",99
3099,So I'm sitting there next to my son and we're at ADCC.,54
3100,So it's a small thing.,22
3101,"And I go, and I said to my son, I go, watch this guy that's about to come out.",78
3102,He's crazy.,11
3103,"And Glover comes out and he like just, he falls on his back, flips inverted guard and starts like just going insane, just doing insane things.",142
3104,"And you know, the rest of the matches are two guys, you know, playing paddy cakes and looking for the takedown.",111
3105,"Glover comes out, falls down, freaking, just doing all kinds of wild stuff.",75
3106,"And then summits the dude in 30s, 38 seconds.",45
3107,"And my son looks at me and he goes, he goes, I thought you meant like crazy.",76
3108,"And he goes, I didn't know you meant crazy.",43
3109,"And I go, yes.",14
3110,He thought you meant like brutish.,34
3111,"Yes, brutish, crazy.",20
3112,You didn't think I meant.,25
3113,Which is weirdly crazy.,23
3114,What that weird creative thing is.,34
3115,"Yeah, that's one of the best things about learning Jiu Jitsu from a small person.",81
3116,"Like those small guys, they figure out how to get around things.",64
3117,"I mean, there's been a bunch of, you know, hoiler graces, a great example of it too.",84
3118,Eddie Glover.,13
3119,"Yeah, that's why I'm never a good, that's why I'm a bad person to introduce people to Jiu Jitsu.",96
3120,Right.,6
3121,"Because they just think, oh yeah, of course you're a gorilla.",61
3122,"You know, you outweigh me by 40 or 50 pounds.",45
3123,Yeah.,5
3124,I always have Jeff Glover on standby at my gym.,47
3125,"Be like, oh, you don't, oh yeah.",32
3126,"Okay, go train with that guy over there.",40
3127,See what happens.,17
3128,"And when Jeff goes against a big strong guy, he's gonna get some.",65
3129,"Yeah, they've really get so disappointed themselves.",52
3130,It's so sad.,12
3131,"He said, he said, the easiest people for him to roll with were big muscular guys.",81
3132,Really?,7
3133,"He said, the easiest people for him to roll with are big muscular guys.",71
3134,Like big muscular guys.,23
3135,"He says, I love roll with them.",31
3136,They're so easy.,16
3137,That's so crazy because most people get injured.,48
3138,"Rolling with like, that's so freaking flexible.",47
3139,Yeah.,5
3140,"His, I think his, I think his neck's jacked up now.",51
3141,"Oh, is it now?",14
3142,That's the thing that gets everybody is the goddamn neck.,57
3143,"The neck, you know, because very few guys really strengthen their neck correctly either.",88
3144,I think the neck is one thing that you absolutely should strengthen.,68
3145,"I think you can get away with not lifting weights and doing Jiu Jitsu, but I don't think you can get away with not strengthening your neck for very long.",153
3146,"Yeah, that's, it's one of those things and it connects you to the rest of your freaking body.",93
3147,You also use it.,16
3148,"You use it more than you think, you know, especially me, I was, my favorite technique is probably head and arm choke.",117
3149,And you're using your neck to secure that arm.,46
3150,"And once you develop a feel for holding that arm in place with that neck, that neck gets a workout back.",104
3151,"You know, you really, you use it a lot more than you think.",59
3152,"And if you can strengthen your neck, it's just, it's such a big advantage.",74
3153,It's also a big advantage in avoiding getting hurt because it strengthens the whole chain from the top of your spine all the way down.,134
3154,"You know, that's why I'm just a big fan of that iron neck.",58
3155,"I just used it right now, right before the podcast, I was doing it.",67
3156,"I do it every fucking day, man.",31
3157,I put that on.,14
3158,I have one.,11
3159,I bought one.,13
3160,Love it.,8
3161,"They emailed me a bunch of like, bro, how do you like it?",57
3162,"I'm like, that's all good.",26
3163,"That's fucking awesome, man.",28
3164,"Between that and, you know, there's a few other back exercises and stuff that I think are critical.",99
3165,"Strengthen a lower back too, because it's another thing that guys always get jacked.",84
3166,Is there a lower back?,22
3167,Yeah.,5
3168,"Even the weird thing is people, people's neck's get jacked up regardless.",73
3169,Like there's people that go through life doing whatever paperwork and they end up with a bad neck.,98
3170,Yeah.,5
3171,The neck is a vulnerable thing.,31
3172,"So, you know, take care of it, especially when you are abusing it, when you are getting choked, when you are not tapping, it's one of those things.",147
3173,I judge people on their neck.,29
3174,On the size of their neck?,26
3175,"Yeah, have I seen someone who's getting neck?",45
3176,Yeah.,5
3177,"What are you doing, man?",24
3178,Yeah.,5
3179,Do some good stuff pretty good.,31
3180,"It's not just, it doesn't seem like it would be a good thing to have.",69
3181,That's the thing that holds your head on.,41
3182,"I can't wait for the future when your neck is all jacked up and you go in and they just put you in surgery for two hours and you come out, you got a metal spine.",161
3183,"I, yeah, I'm going to be the first person.",42
3184,"I'm, I'm right in line.",23
3185,You want to give me a metal spine or any metal components inside my body?,73
3186,You're down with that?,22
3187,I'm 100% down.,14
3188,Let's make it happen.,21
3189,He's got a fake disc.,21
3190,He's got a titanium articulating disc.,38
3191,Which way?,10
3192,Lower back.,11
3193,"His lower back had been so smashed and suppressed that his, you know, that's one of the things that's why men when they get older, they shrink.",143
3194,Is your discs get squished to the point and they start touching.,64
3195,You get stenosis.,17
3196,Do you think you can go too far with flexibility that it starts to injure you over the long term?,97
3197,"Well, I don't think you can go too far with flexibility but flexibility without strength perhaps because maybe that inflexibility, like maybe you'll get like some muscle damage, you know, when you're trying to push too far then it'll prevent you from getting disc damage.",271
3198,Maybe.,6
3199,That's just speculation.,24
3200,But I think it's critical.,26
3201,"It's just so critical to strengthen your back, man.",51
3202,"I mean, I'm always doing reverse hypers and I do all these different like back extensions.",90
3203,"I just think strengthening that whole column and yoga in particular and then the neck, the iron neck.",101
3204,I just think that whole thing.,30
3205,"It's like too many guys just rely on their workouts to strengthen that and they don't take it as like, hey, I really like doing Jiu Jitsu.",138
3206,I really like doing Moitai.,27
3207,I wanna put in the time to work out these areas.,48
3208,How's that he's back now?,25
3209,It's not 100%.,14
3210,It's still fucked with him a little bit but he's rolling again but he's got to fake discs.,90
3211,"A disc, it's a titanium disc that they replace the smooshy part with this thing that rolls and moves but it still creates some inflammation whenever, look, I know, I had Ronnie Coleman here last week.",200
3212,"I know, I listened to it.",25
3213,"His whole back is all fused and it's horrible, man.",51
3214,"I mean, he can't walk and he's the king.",40
3215,Greatest Olympian of all time.,30
3216,"I mean, he's a fucking amazing pro bodybuilder.",47
3217,"Eight time, Mr. Olympia.",24
3218,I watched the documentary.,26
3219,Did you see the documentary?,28
3220,"No, I didn't.",13
3221,I didn't.,9
3222,"Really good, man.",17
3223,"Really just, what a good guy.",29
3224,Great guy.,10
3225,What a nice guy.,16
3226,Could be nicer.,15
3227,"And in pain, in fucking agony, just friendly and wouldn't have it any other way.",80
3228,"And he talks about the days that he like, he was talking about squat and 800 pounds and that like he said he was gonna do it for two reps and after the two reps, he could say, I could have gotten more.",201
3229,"And to this day, he thinks he should have got more.",51
3230,"That's what we were talking about earlier, right?",49
3231,That's keeping him up at night.,31
3232,That's why he's a champion.,27
3233,"I mean, that really is.",23
3234,That's what made him a champion.,32
3235,Did you watch the West Side versus the world documentary?,57
3236,"No, I didn't.",13
3237,I got to interview Louis.,25
3238,"Yeah, I got to listen to that one too.",38
3239,For a type right here.,22
3240,"I have another piece of his equipment too, that belt squat machine, which is amazing.",85
3241,It puts all the weight on your hips versus on your back.,56
3242,He's a fucking wild dude.,25
3243,Wild.,5
3244,I wanna go out there and hang out.,34
3245,"Oh, he would love you, man.",27
3246,He would love you.,18
3247,"You would love him too, man.",28
3248,That is who Louis is.,21
3249,And he's got this fucking gym filled with barbarians.,53
3250,"Oh, yeah.",9
3251,Just all they're doing is just trying to lift the maximum amount of weight they can lift.,89
3252,It's insane.,12
3253,My kid watched that.,20
3254,"And he, you know, I think he's just all about it now.",53
3255,Right side.,11
3256,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.",19
3257,Everyone's little buddies talking about Louis Simmons.,54
3258,"You know, he's contagious.",26
3259,Go heavier.,11
3260,"I mean, Jamie and I were in his office interview, and that's where we did it.",77
3261,We actually did the podcast at West Side.,41
3262,"Yeah, I was in Columbus doing stand up, and I just had an interview.",68
3263,"I just knew, I knew just like, I wanna get the guy in his gym too.",66
3264,It was just fucking amazing.,28
3265,"He gave us a tour of the gym, and then we did a podcast at his desk.",68
3266,It was awesome.,15
3267,What a rare human being.,24
3268,"Yeah, they don't make them like Louis Simmons, but also a genius.",65
3269,"Like here's a guy who figured out like his disc was fucked up, and they were like, we're gonna fuse you.",104
3270,"And he's like, well, let me think of this.",42
3271,Something made it compress.,27
3272,I'm gonna figure out something to make it decompress and strengthen that area.,78
3273,"And that's where the reverse hyper came from, which I think should be a staple in every gym.",92
3274,"That reverse hyper machine for strengthening the lower back and then an actively decompressing, I've never found anything better.",129
3275,And that's all in Louis Simmons' mind.,38
3276,He came out of his own brain because of his injury.,51
3277,That he came back from after.,29
3278,"Yeah, and was squatting whatever, 729 world record at whatever's 62 years old.",78
3279,"Yeah, but I wouldn't recommend anything he does.",48
3280,"I mean, here's the guy who got his biceps reattached, and then blew it out because it was too annoying to not be able to work out.",130
3281,So he just went back to working out and popped snap back off.,61
3282,"No, they all called, so he's got no biceps.",43
3283,Just pulls back.,16
3284,Crazy animal.,13
3285,He got his shoulder redone.,27
3286,"They gave him an artificial shoulder, goes back to the gym and they're like, you're gonna max out today.",104
3287,His friends made him max out after his shoulder surgery with an artificial shoulder.,84
3288,"Like, okay, like that's just the culture.",41
3289,Yeah.,5
3290,The culture doesn't matter.,27
3291,Injuries don't matter.,22
3292,"In the documentary, one of the guys was saying, my goal was to hurt Louis when he came in the gym.",98
3293,My goal was to hurt him.,24
3294,I wanted him to get hurt.,25
3295,I wanted to push him so hard that he got hurt.,46
3296,And this is one of his buddies.,31
3297,"One of his friends, one of his training partners.",49
3298,My goal was to hurt him.,24
3299,That's that culture though.,27
3300,"I mean, that's how you develop such a legendary place.",54
3301,You have to have the sensibilities are beyond a normal person would consider a prudent thing to do.,99
3302,"Yeah, and if people, the people that could withstand that kind of pressure became champions, became world record holders.",121
3303,"It's all about the mind, Jago.",30
3304,That's what it takes.,21
3305,"Nobody knows one, yeah.",23
3306,"We just said three hours, dude.",31
3307,I'm gonna give you a COVID test now.,36
3308,It's 3.30.,10
3309,Let's get some.,15
3310,"All right, let's get some.",26
3311,Thank you brother.,18
3312,Appreciate you man.,19
3313,Bye everybody.,14
3314,Awesome.,8
