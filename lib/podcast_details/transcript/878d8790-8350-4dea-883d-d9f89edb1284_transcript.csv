0," By the time it gets to 2045, we'll be able to multiply our intelligence many millions full.",92
1,And it's just very hard to imagine what that will be like.,58
2,"The following is a conversation with Ray Kurzweil, author, inventor, and futurist, who has an optimistic view of our future as a human civilization, predicting that exponentially improving technologies will take us to a point of a singularity, beyond which super intelligent artificial intelligence will transform our world in nearly unimaginable ways.",352
3,"18 years ago, in the book Singularity is near, he predicted that the onset of the Singularity will happen in the year 2045.",123
4,He still holds to this prediction and estimate.,47
5,"In fact, he's working on a new book on this topic that will hopefully be out next year.",87
6,This is the Lex Friedman podcast that supported.,48
7,Please check out our sponsors in the description.,49
8,"And now dear friends, here's Ray Kurzweil.",42
9,"In your 2005 book titled The Singularity is Near, you predicted that the Singularity will happen in 2045.",105
10,"So now 18 years later, do you still estimate that the Singularity will happen on 2045?",86
11,"It may be first what is the Singularity, the technological Singularity, and when will it happen?",96
12,Singularity is where computers really change our view of what's important and change who we are.,96
13,But we're getting close to some salient things that will change who we are.,75
14,A key thing is 2029 when computers will pass the Turing test.,61
15,"And there's also some controversy whether the Turing test is valid, I believe it is.",84
16,"Most people do believe that, but there's some controversy about that.",69
17,But Stanford got very alarmed at my prediction about 2029.,58
18,I made this in 1999.,20
19,In my book The Age of Spiritual Machines.,41
20,And then you repeated the prediction in 2005.,45
21,In 2005.,8
22,"So the held international conference you might have been aware of it, of AI experts in 1999 to assess this view.",112
23,So people gave different predictions and they took a poll.,58
24,It was really the first time that AI experts worldwide were pulled on this prediction.,86
25,And the average poll was 100 years.,35
26,20% believed it would never happen.,35
27,And that was the view in 1999.,30
28,"80% believed it would happen, but not within their lifetimes.",61
29,There's been so many advances in AI that the poll of AI experts has come down over the years.,93
30,"So a year ago something called meticulous, which maybe you were assesses different types of experts on the future, they again assess what AI experts then felt.",159
31,And they were saying 2042.,26
32,For the Turing test.,20
33,For the Turing test.,20
34,So it's coming down.,20
35,And I was still saying 2029.,28
36,"A few weeks ago, they again did another poll and it was 2030.",61
37,So AI experts now basically agree with me.,42
38,I haven't changed at all.,25
39,I've stayed with 2029.,22
40,"And AI experts now agree with me, but they didn't agree at first.",65
41,So Alan Turing formulated the Turing test.,42
42,And Right.,10
43,Now what he said was very little about it.,42
44,I mean the 1950 paper where he had articulated the Turing test.,63
45,There's like a few lines that talk about the Turing test.,57
46,And it really wasn't to very clear how to administer it.,56
47,"And he said if they did it in like 15 minutes, there would be sufficient, which I don't really think is the case.",113
48,These large language models.,28
49,Now some people are convinced by it already.,44
50,I mean you can talk to it and have a conversation with you.,59
51,You can actually talk to it for hours.,38
52,"So it requires a little more depth that some problems with large language models, which we can talk about.",106
53,But some people are convinced by the Turing test.,49
54,"Now if somebody passes the Turing test, what are the implications of that?",74
55,"Does that mean that they're sentient, that they're conscious or not?",68
56,It's not necessarily clear what the implications are.,53
57,"Anyway, I believe 2029, that's six, seven years from now, we'll have something to pass the Turing test and a valid Turing test.",127
58,"Meaning it goes for hours, not just a few minutes.",50
59,Please speak to that a little bit.,34
60,What is your formulation of the Turing test?,44
61,You've proposed a very difficult version of the Turing test.,60
62,So what does that look like?,28
63,Basically it's just to assess it over several hours and also have a human judge that's fairly sophisticated on what computers can do and can't do.,146
64,"If you take somebody who's not that sophisticated or even an average engineer, they may not really assess various aspects of it.",128
65,So you really want the human to challenge the system.,53
66,Exactly.,8
67,On its ability to do things that common sense reasoning perhaps.,64
68,That's actually a key problem with large language models.,57
69,They don't do these kinds of tests that would involve assessing chains of reasoning.,84
70,But you can lose track of them.,31
71,"If you talk to them, they actually can talk to you pretty well and you can be convinced by it.",94
72,But it's somebody that would really convince you that it's a human.,67
73,"Whatever that takes, maybe it would take days or weeks, but it would really convince you that it's human.",105
74,Large language models can appear that way.,42
75,You can read conversations and they appear pretty good.,55
76,There are some problems with it.,32
77,It doesn't do math very well.,29
78,"You can ask how many legs did 10 elephants have and they'll tell you, well, okay, each elephant has four legs and 10 elephants, so it's 40 legs and you go, okay, that's pretty good.",181
79,How many legs do 11 elephants have?,35
80,And they don't seem to understand the question.,47
81,Do all humans understand that question?,39
82,No.,3
83,That's the key thing.,21
84,How advanced the human do you want it to be?,44
85,"But we do expect the human to be able to do multi-chain reasoning, to be able to take a few facts and put them together, not perfectly.",135
86,We see that in a lot of polls that people don't do that perfectly at all.,73
87,"So it's not very well-defined, but it's something where it really would convince you that it's human.",101
88,Is your intuition that large language models will not be solely the kind of system that passes the touring test in 2029?,120
89,Do we need something else?,26
90,"No, I think it will be a large language one, but they have to go beyond what they're doing now.",95
91,I think we're getting there.,28
92,"And another key issue is if somebody actually passes the touring test validly, I would believe they're conscious.",113
93,And not everybody would say that.,33
94,"It's okay, we can pass the touring test, but we don't really believe that it's conscious.",89
95,That's a whole nother issue.,28
96,"But if it really passes the touring test, I would believe that it's conscious.",78
97,But I don't believe that of large language models today.,56
98,"If it appears to be conscious, that's as good as being conscious, at least for you, in some sense.",98
99,"I mean, consciousness is not something that's scientific.",57
100,"I mean, I believe you're conscious, but it's really just to believe.",68
101,"When we believe that about other humans that at least appear to be conscious, when you go outside of shared human assumption, like our animals conscious, some people believe they're not conscious, some people believe they are conscious.",236
102,"And would a machine that actually just like a human being conscious, I mean, I believe it would be.",99
103,But that's really a philosophical belief.,41
104,"It's not, you can't prove it.",29
105,I can't take an entity and prove that it's conscious.,53
106,There's nothing that you can do.,32
107,"They would be, they would indicate that.",40
108,It's like saying a piece of art is beautiful.,45
109,You can say it.,15
110,"Multiple people can experience a piece of art is beautiful, but you can't prove it.",83
111,But it's also an extremely important issue.,43
112,"I mean, imagine if you had something with nobody's conscious, the world may as well not exist.",94
113,"And so some people like say Marvin Rinsky said, well, consciousness is not logical, it's not scientific, and therefore we should dismiss it and any talk about consciousness is just not to be believed.",200
114,"But when he actually engaged with somebody who was conscious, he actually acted as if they were conscious.",106
115,He didn't ignore that.,22
116,He acted as if consciousness does matter.,41
117,Exactly.,8
118,Whereas he said it didn't matter.,33
119,"Well, that's Marvin Rinsky.",27
120,He's full of contradictions.,28
121,But that's true of a lot of people as well.,43
122,But do you consciousness matters?,33
123,"To me, it's very important, but I would say it's not a scientific issue.",72
124,It's a philosophical issue.,27
125,And people have different views.,32
126,Some people believe that anything that makes a decision is conscious.,69
127,So your light switch is conscious.,34
128,It's a level of consciousness.,30
129,It's low.,9
130,"It's not very interesting, but that's a consciousness.",54
131,"And anything so a computer that makes a more interesting decision still at human levels, but it's also conscious and at a higher level than your light switch.",158
132,So that's one view.,19
133,There's many different views of what consciousness is.,54
134,"So for a system passes the Turing test, it's not scientific, but in issues of philosophy, things like ethics start to enter the picture.",136
135,"Do you think there would be, we would start contending as a human species about the ethics of turning off such a machine?",121
136,Yeah.,5
137,"I mean, that's definitely come up.",34
138,"Hasn't come up in reality yet, but yet.",39
139,But I'm talking about 2029.,27
140,It's not that many years from now.,34
141,So what are our obligations to it?,34
142,"It has a different, I mean, a computer that's conscious, has a little bit different connotations than a human.",110
143,We have a continuous consciousness.,35
144,We're in an entity that's not last forever.,43
145,"Now, actually, significant portion of humans still exist and are there for still conscious.",91
146,But anybody who is over a certain age doesn't exist anymore.,60
147,That wouldn't be true of a computer program.,44
148,You could completely turn it off and the copy of it could be stored and you could recreate it.,94
149,And so it has a different type of validity.,43
150,You could actually take it back in time.,40
151,You could eliminate its memory and have it go over again.,57
152,"I mean, it has a different kind of connotation than humans do.",62
153,"Well, perhaps you can do the same thing with humans.",52
154,It's just that we don't know how to do that yet.,48
155,Yeah.,5
156,It's possible that we figure out all of these things on the machine first.,74
157,But that doesn't mean the machine isn't conscious.,50
158,"I mean, if you look at the way people react, say, three CPO or other machines that are conscious in movies, they don't actually present how it's conscious.",155
159,But we see that they are a machine and people will believe that they are conscious.,83
160,And they'll actually worry about it if they get in trouble and so on.,69
161,"So, 2029 is going to be the first year when a major thing happens.",66
162,Right.,6
163,And that will shake our civilization to start to consider the role of AI.,73
164,Yes.,4
165,No.,3
166,"I mean, this one guy at Google claimed that the machine was conscious.",70
167,But that's just one person.,27
168,Right.,6
169,So it starts to happen to scale.,32
170,"Well, that's exactly right.",27
171,Because most people have not taken that position.,49
172,I don't take that position.,27
173,"I mean, I've used different things like this and they don't appear to me to be conscious.",89
174,"As we eliminate various problems of these large language models, more and more people will accept that they're conscious.",121
175,"So when we get to 2029 more, I think a large fraction of people will believe that they're conscious.",100
176,So it's not going to happen all at once.,40
177,I believe they would actually happen gradually and this already started to happen.,82
178,And so that takes us one step closer to the singularity.,56
179,"Another step then is in the 2030s when we can actually connect our Neo Cortex, which is where we do our thinking to computers.",126
180,"And I mean, just this actually gains a lot to being connected to computers that will amplify its abilities.",107
181,"I mean, if this did not have any connection, it would be pretty stupid.",71
182,It could not answer any of your questions.,42
183,"If you're just listening to this, by the way, race holding up the all-powerful smartphone.",90
184,So we're going to do that directly from our brains.,51
185,"I mean, these are pretty good.",30
186,These are already amplified our intelligence.,45
187,I'm already much smarter than I would otherwise be if I didn't have this.,73
188,"Because I remember when I first spoke the Age of Intelligent Machines, there was no way to get information from computers.",122
189,"I actually would go to a library, find a book, find the page that had an information I wanted, and I go to the copier and my most significant information tool was a role of quarters where I could feed the copier.",212
190,So we're already greatly advanced that we have these things.,60
191,There's a few problems with it.,31
192,"First of all, I constantly put it down and I don't remember where I put it.",75
193,I've actually never lost it.,28
194,But you have to find it and then you have to turn it on.,56
195,So there's a certain amount of steps.,37
196,"It would actually be quite useful if someone would just listen to your conversation and say, oh, that's some sort of actress and tell you what you're talking about.",164
197,"Going from active to passive, where it just permeates your whole life.",70
198,"The way your brain does when you're awake, your brain is always there.",70
199,Right.,6
200,"That's something that could actually just about be done today where we would listen to your conversation, understand what you're saying, understand what you're not missing and give you that information.",202
201,But another step is to actually go inside your brain.,53
202,And there are some prototypes where you can connect your brain.,63
203,They actually don't have the amount of bandwidth that we need.,62
204,"They can work, but they work fairly slowly.",43
205,"So if it actually would connect to your neocortex, and the neocortex, which I described and how to create a mind, the neocortex is actually, it has different levels.",165
206,"And as you go up the levels, it's kind of like a pyramid.",57
207,The top level is fairly small.,30
208,And that's the level where you want to connect these brain extenders.,69
209,So I believe that will happen in the 2030s.,43
210,So just the way this is greatly amplified by being connected to the cloud.,74
211,We can connect our own brain to the cloud.,42
212,And just do what we can do by using this machine.,49
213,Do you think it would look like the brain computer interface of like your link?,79
214,So would it be?,15
215,"Well, there are links to an attempt to do that.",47
216,It doesn't have the bandwidth that we need.,43
217,"Yeah, right.",12
218,"But I think, I mean, they're going to get permission for this because there are a lot of people who absolutely need it because they can't communicate.",150
219,I know a couple of people like that who have ideas and they cannot move their muscles and so on.,96
220,They can't communicate.,23
221,"So for them, this would be very valuable.",41
222,But we could all use it.,24
223,"Basically, it would be premise into something that would be like we have a phone, but it would be in our minds.",111
224,It would be kind of instantaneous.,34
225,And maybe communication between two people would not require this low bandwidth mechanism of language.,102
226,"Yeah, spoken word.",18
227,Exactly.,8
228,We don't know what that would be.,33
229,Although we do know the computers can share information like language instantly.,80
230,"They can share many, many books in a second.",44
231,So we could do that as well.,28
232,"If you look at what our brain does, it actually can manipulate different parameters.",84
233,So we talk about these large language models.,45
234,"I mean, I had written that it requires a certain amount of information in order to be effective.",96
235,And then we would not see AI really being effective until it got to that level.,79
236,And we had lots of language models that were like 10 billion bytes.,67
237,It didn't work very well.,25
238,They finally got to 100 billion bytes.,38
239,And now they work fairly well.,30
240,And now we're going to a trillion bytes.,40
241,"If you say Lambda has 100 billion bytes, what does that mean?",61
242,"Well, what if you had something that had one byte, one one parameter?",69
243,Maybe you want to tell whether or not something's an elephant or not.,69
244,And so you put in something that would detect its trunk.,56
245,"If it has a trunk, it's an elephant.",36
246,"If it doesn't have a trunk, it's not an elephant.",49
247,Now we work fairly well.,24
248,This is a few problems with it.,31
249,And it really wouldn't be able to tell what a trunk is.,55
250,"But anyway, and maybe other things other than elephants have trunks, you might get really confused.",99
251,"Yeah, exactly.",14
252,"I'm not sure which animals have trunks, but you know, it's how you define a trunk.",82
253,"But yeah, that's one parameter.",31
254,You can do okay.,16
255,So these things have 100 billion parameters.,44
256,So they're able to deal with very complex issues.,49
257,All kinds of trunks.,20
258,"Human beings actually have a little bit more than that, but they're getting to the point where they can emulate humans.",119
259,"If we were able to connect this to our neocortex, we would basically add more of these abilities to make distinctions.",118
260,And it could ultimately be much smarter and also be attached to information that we feel is reliable.,101
261,So that's where we're headed.,29
262,"So you think that there will be a merger in the 30s, an increasing amount of merging between the human brain and the AI brain.",126
263,Exactly.,8
264,And the AI brain is really an emulation of human beings.,56
265,"I mean, that's why we're creating them because human beings act the same way.",77
266,And this is basically to amplify them.,38
267,"I mean, this amplifies our brain.",33
268,"It's a little clumsy to interact with, but it definitely is way beyond what we had 15 years ago.",96
269,"But the implementation becomes different, just like a bird versus the airplane.",79
270,"Even though the AI brain is an emulation, it starts adding features we might not otherwise have, like ability to consume a huge amount of information quickly, like look up thousands of Wikipedia articles in one take.",216
271,Exactly.,8
272,"For example, to issues like simulated biology where it can simulate many different things at once.",98
273,"We already had one example of simulated biology, which is the Moderna vaccine.",78
274,And that's going to be now the way in which we create medications.,66
275,But they were able to simulate what each example of an mRNA would do to a human being.,86
276,And they were able to simulate that quite reliably.,51
277,And we actually simulated billions of different mRNA sequences.,63
278,And they found the ones that were the best than they created the vaccine.,73
279,And they did and talked about doing it quickly.,47
280,They did that in two days.,26
281,"Now, how long would a human being take to simulate billions of different mRNA sequences?",88
282,"I don't know that we could do it at all, but it would take many years.",70
283,They did it in two days.,24
284,And one of the reasons that people didn't like vaccines is because it was done too quickly.,91
285,It was done too fast.,21
286,"And they actually included the time it took to test it out, which was 10 months.",80
287,So they figured it took 10 months to create this.,49
288,"Actually, it took us two days.",30
289,And we also will be able to ultimately do the tests in a few days as well.,74
290,"Well, because we can simulate how the body will respond to it.",62
291,"Yeah, more and more.",20
292,That's a little bit more complicated because the body has a lot of different elements.,86
293,And we have to simulate all of that.,36
294,But that's coming as well.,26
295,"So ultimately, we could create it in a few days and then test it in a few days and it would be done.",100
296,And we can do that with every type of medical insufficiency that we have.,73
297,"So curing all diseases, improving certain functions of the body, supplements, drugs for recreation, for health, for performance, for productivity, all that.",156
298,"Well, that's where we're headed.",32
299,Because right now we are very inefficient way of creating these new medications.,80
300,But we've already shown it.,27
301,And the Moderna vaccine is actually the best of the vaccines we've had.,71
302,And it literally took two days to create.,41
303,And we'll get to the point where we can test it out also quickly.,65
304,"Are you impressed by alpha-fold and the solution to the protein folding, which essentially is simulating modeling this primitive building block of life, which is a protein, and it's 3D shape.",191
305,It's pretty remarkable that they can actually predict what the 3D shape of these things are.,92
306,"But they did it with the same type of neural net that one, for example, the go test.",84
307,So it's all the same.,21
308,They took that same thing and just changed the rules to chess.,62
309,"And within a couple of days, it now played a master's level of chess greater than any human being.",98
310,"And the same thing that worked for alpha-fold, which no human had done.",71
311,"Human beings could do the best humans could maybe do 15, 20% of figuring out what the shape would be.",101
312,"After a few takes, it also made it just about 100%.",51
313,Do you still think the singularity will happen in 2045?,55
314,And what does that look like?,29
315,"You know, once we can amplify our brain with computers directly, which will happen in the 2030s, that's going to keep growing.",126
316,"It's another whole theme, which is the exponential growth of computing power.",77
317,"Yeah, so looking at price performance of computation from 1939 to 2021.",71
318,"Right, so that starts with the very first computer actually created by German during World War 2.",97
319,"And you might have thought that that might be significant, but actually the Germans didn't think computers were significant and they completely rejected it.",156
320,And the second one is also the Zeus of 2.,41
321,"And by the way, we're looking at a plot with the X-axis being the year from 1935 to 2025.",89
322,And on the Y-axis and log scale is competition per second per constant dollar.,78
323,So dollar normalized inflation.,31
324,"And it's growing linearly on the log scale, which means it's growing exponentially.",83
325,"The third one was the British computer, which the Allies did take very seriously.",81
326,"And it cracked the German code and enables the British to win the Battle of Britain, which otherwise absolutely would not have happened if they hadn't cracked the code using that computer.",188
327,But that's an exponential graph.,32
328,So a straight line on that graph is exponential growth.,55
329,And you see 80 years of exponential growth.,43
330,"And I would say about every five years, and this happened shortly before the pandemic, people saying, well, they call it Moore's Law, which is not the correct, because it's not all Intel.",187
331,"In fact, it started decades before Intel was even created.",58
332,It wasn't with transistors formed into a grid.,46
333,It was not just transistor count or transistor size.,52
334,Right.,6
335,"It was started with green, with relays.",39
336,Then went to vacuum tubes.,26
337,Then went to individual transistors.,36
338,And then to integrated circuits.,32
339,And integrated circuits actually starts like in the middle of this graph.,73
340,And it has nothing to do with Intel.,36
341,Intel actually was a key part of this.,38
342,"But a few years ago, they stopped making the fastest chips.",59
343,"But if you take the fastest chip of any technology in that year, you get this kind of graph.",92
344,And it's definitely continuing for 80 years.,44
345,So you don't think Moore's Law broadly defined his dead.,56
346,It's been declared dead multiple times.,39
347,Throughout this process.,24
348,I don't like the term Moore's Law because it has nothing to do with Moore or with Intel.,88
349,"But yes, the exponential growth of computing is continuing.",59
350,It has never stopped from various sources.,42
351,"I mean, it went through World War II.",37
352,It went through global recessions.,34
353,It's just continuing.,21
354,"And if you continue that out, along with software gains, which is on another issue.",83
355,"And they really multiply whatever you get from software gains, you multiply by the computer gains, you get faster and faster speed.",131
356,This is actually the fastest computer models that have been created.,68
357,And that actually expands roughly twice a year.,47
358,"Like every six months, it expands, but two.",43
359,"So we're looking at a plot from 2010 to 2022 on the X-axis, the publication data, the model, and perhaps sometimes the actual paper associated with it.",151
360,And on the Y-axis is training compute and flops.,48
361,"And so basically, this is looking at the increase in the not transistors, but the computational power of neural networks.",121
362,"Yes, the computational power that created these models.",55
363,And that's doubled every six months.,36
364,She's even faster than transistor division.,43
365,Yeah.,5
366,"Actually, since I got faster than the amount of cost, this has actually become a greater investment to create these.",116
367,"But at any rate, by the time you get to 2045, we'll be able to multiply our intelligence many millions full.",108
368,And it's just very hard to imagine what that will be like.,58
369,And that's the singularity where we can't even imagine.,55
370,Right.,6
371,That's why we call it the singularity.,38
372,"The singularity in physics, something gets sucked into it singularity.",70
373,And you can't tell what's going on in there because no information can get out of it.,85
374,There's various problems with that.,35
375,But that's the idea.,20
376,It's too much beyond what we can imagine.,41
377,Do you think it's possible we don't notice that what the singularity actually feels like is we just live through it with exponentially increasing cognitive capabilities.,169
378,"And we almost, because everything's moving so quickly, don't aren't really able to introspect that our life has changed.",120
379,Yeah.,5
380,"But I mean, we will have that much greater capacity to understand things.",73
381,"So we should be able to look back looking at history, understand history.",73
382,But we will need people basically like you and me to actually think about these things.,87
383,Think about it.,15
384,But we might be distracted by all the other sources of entertainment and fun because the exponential power of intellect is growing.,131
385,"But also, there'll be a lot of fun.",35
386,"The amount of ways you can have, you know, I mean, we already have a lot of fun with computer games and so on that are really quite remarkable.",143
387,"What do you think about the digital world, the metaverse virtual reality?",73
388,Will that have a component in this or will most of our advancement be in physical?,82
389,"Well, that's a little bit like second life, although the second life actually didn't work very well because it couldn't actually handle too many people.",152
390,And I don't think the metaverse has come to being.,50
391,I think there will be something like that that will necessarily be from that one company.,89
392,"I mean, there's going to be competitors.",40
393,"But yes, we're going to live increasingly online.",49
394,"And particularly when if our brains are online, I mean, how could we not be online?",83
395,"Do you think it's possible that given this merger with AI, most of our meaningful interactions will be in this virtual world, most of our life, we fall in love, we make friends, we come up with ideas, we do collaborations, we have fun.",235
396,"Actually, no somebody who's marrying somebody that they never met.",66
397,Yeah.,5
398,"I think they just met her briefly before the wedding, but she actually fell in love with this other person, never having met them.",130
399,And I think the love is real.,29
400,So that's a beautiful story.,28
401,"But do you think that story is one that might be experienced as opposed to by hundreds of thousands of people, but instead by hundreds of millions of people?",157
402,"I mean, it really gives you appreciation for these virtual ways of communicating.",81
403,"And if anybody can do it, then it's really not such a freak story.",66
404,So I think more and more people will do that.,45
405,But that's turning our back on our entire history of evolution.,63
406,"Or the old days we used to fall in love by holding hands and sitting by the fire, that kind of stuff.",101
407,"Here you're actually have five patents on where you can hold hands, even if you're separated.",93
408,Great.,6
409,"So the touch, the sense, it's all just senses.",46
410,It's all just.,14
411,Yeah.,5
412,"I mean, it's not just that you're touching someone or not.",58
413,There's a whole way of doing it.,32
414,And it's a very subtle and but ultimately we can emulate all of that.,69
415,Are you excited about that future?,34
416,Do you worry about that future?,31
417,"I've certainly worried about the future, but not that virtual touch.",68
418,"Well, I agree with you.",23
419,You described six stages in the evolution of information processing in the universe as you started to describe.,111
420,"Can you maybe talk through some of those stages from the physics and chemistry to DNA and brains and then to the to the very end, to the very beautiful end of this process?",172
421,It actually gets more rapid.,28
422,"So physics and chemistry, that's how we started.",48
423,So we had very beginning of the universe.,41
424,We had lots of electrons and first things traveling around.,59
425,"And that took actually many billions of years, kind of jumping ahead here to kind of some of the last stages where we have things like love and creativity.",155
426,It's really quite remarkable that that happens.,47
427,But finally physics and chemistry created biology and DNA.,58
428,And now you had actually one type of molecule that described the cutting edge of this process.,94
429,And we go from physics and chemistry to biology.,48
430,And finally biology created brains.,35
431,Not everything that's created by biology has a brain.,53
432,But eventually brains came along.,33
433,And all of this is happening faster and faster.,47
434,Yeah.,5
435,It created increasingly complex organisms.,42
436,"Another key thing is actually not just brains, but our thumb.",61
437,Because there's a lot of animals with brains even bigger than humans.,69
438,"I mean, elephants have a bigger brain.",38
439,Whales have a bigger brain.,27
440,But they've not created technology because they don't have a thumb.,67
441,So that's one of the really key elements in the evolution of humans.,68
442,"This physical manipulator device, that's useful for puzzle solving in the physical reality.",91
443,"So I could think they could look at a tree and go, oh, I could actually trip that branch down and eliminate the leaves and carve a tip on it and create technology.",163
444,And you can't do that if you don't have a thumb.,48
445,So thumbs and created technology and technology also had a memory.,66
446,And now those memories are competing with the scale and scope of human beings.,78
447,And ultimately we'll go beyond it.,34
448,"And then we're going to merge human technology with human intelligence and understand how human intelligence works, which I think we already do.",144
449,And we're putting that into our human technology.,49
450,So create the technology inspired by our own intelligence and then that technology supersedes us in terms of its capabilities.,126
451,And we ride along.,18
452,Or do you do you ultimately see it as fun?,42
453,"We ride along, but a lot of people don't see that.",50
454,"They say, well, you've got humans and then you've got machines and there's no way we can alter the league compete with humans.",126
455,And you can already see that.,29
456,Leads of dolls who's like the best go player in the world.,58
457,So if he's not going to play Go anymore.,40
458,Yeah.,5
459,"Because playing Go for human, that was like the ultimate in intelligence because no one else could do that.",107
460,But now a machine can actually go way beyond him.,49
461,"And so he says, well, there's no point playing it anymore.",58
462,That may be more true for games than it is for life.,52
463,I think there's a lot of benefit to working together with AI in regular life.,77
464,"So if you were to put a probability on it, is it more likely that we merge with AI or AI replaces us?",101
465,A lot of people just think computers come along and they compete with them.,75
466,We can't really compete.,24
467,And that's the end of it.,25
468,As opposed to them increasing our abilities.,44
469,"And if you look at most technology, it increases our abilities.",63
470,Look at the history of work.,28
471,Look at what people did 100 years ago.,38
472,Does any of that exist anymore?,31
473,"I mean, if you were to predict that all of these jobs would go away and it would be done by machines, people would say, well, no one's going to have jobs.",154
474,It's going to be massive unemployment.,38
475,"But I show in this book, this coming out, the amount of people that are working, even as a percentage of the population has come way up.",136
476,We're looking at the X-axis year from 1774 to 2024.,51
477,And on the Y-axis personal income per capita in constant dollars and it's growing super linearly.,97
478,"I mean, it's 2021 constant dollars and it's gone way up.",56
479,"That's not what you were to predict, given that we were to predict that all these jobs would go away.",101
480,But the reason it's gone up is because we've basically enhanced our own capabilities by using these machines as opposed to them just competing with us.,151
481,That's a key way in which we're going to be able to become far smarter than we are now by increasing the number of different primitives we can consider in making a decision.,173
482,I was very fortunate.,21
483,"I am very fortunate to be able to get a glimpse preview of your upcoming book, Singularity's Nearer.",100
484,"And one of the themes outside of just discussing the increasing exponential growth of technology, one of the themes is that things are getting better in all aspects of life.",173
485,And you talk just about just about this.,40
486,So one of the things you're saying is with jobs.,48
487,So let me just ask about that.,30
488,"There is a big concern that automation, especially powerful AI will get rid of jobs.",84
489,People will lose jobs.,22
490,"And as you were saying, the senses throughout history of the 20th century automation did not do that ultimately.",112
491,"So the question is, will this time be different?",48
492,Right.,6
493,That is the question.,21
494,Will this time be different?,28
495,And it really has to do with how quickly we can merge with this type of intelligence.,85
496,"With a Lambda GPT-3 is out there, maybe it's overcome some of its key problems.",79
497,And we really have an enhanced human intelligence that might be a negative scenario.,84
498,"But I mean, that's why we create technologies to enhance ourselves.",67
499,And I believe we will be enhanced when I'm just going to sit here with 300 million modules in our Neo Cortex.,109
500,We're going to be able to go beyond that.,41
501,"Because that's useful, but we can multiply that by 10, 100,000 million.",71
502,"And you might think, well, what's the point of doing that?",58
503,"It's like asking somebody that's never heard music, well, what's the value of music?",84
504,"I mean, you can't appreciate it until you've created it.",56
505,There's some worry that there will be a wealth disparity.,57
506,"You know, a class or wealth disparity, only the rich people will be.",68
507,"Basically, the rich people will first have access to this kind of thing.",72
508,"And then because of this kind of thing, because the ability to merge will get richer, exponentially faster.",107
509,And I say that's just like cell phones.,39
510,"I mean, there's like four billion cell phones in the world today.",65
511,"In fact, cell phones first came out.",36
512,You had to be fairly wealthy.,29
513,They weren't very inexpensive.,30
514,So you'd have some wealth in order to afford them.,50
515,"Yeah, there were these big, sexy phones.",40
516,And they didn't work very well.,31
517,They did almost nothing.,24
518,So you can only afford these things if you're wealthy at a point where they really don't work very well.,104
519,So achieving scale is and making it inexpensive is part of making a thing more.,79
520,Exactly.,8
521,"So these are not totally cheap, but they're pretty cheap.",57
522,"I mean, you can get them for a few hundred dollars.",51
523,Especially given the kind of things that provides for you.,58
524,"There's a lot of people in the third world that have very little, but they have a smartphone.",93
525,"Yeah, absolutely.",17
526,And the same will be true with AI.,34
527,"I mean, I see homeless people have their own cell phones.",57
528,"Yeah, so your sense is any kind of advanced technology will take the same trajectory.",85
529,Right.,6
530,It also becomes cheap and will be affordable.,45
531,I probably would not be the first person to put something in my brain to connect to computers.,94
532,Because I think it will have limitations.,41
533,"But once it's really perfected, at that point it will be pretty inexpensive.",76
534,I think it will be pretty affordable.,37
535,"So in which other ways, as you outline your book, is life getting better?",73
536,"Because I think, well, I have, I mean, I have 50 charts in there.",65
537,"Yeah, where everything is getting better.",41
538,"I think there's a kind of cynicism about, even if we look at extreme poverty, for example.",90
539,"For example, this is actually a poll taken on extreme poverty.",62
540,"And the people who were asked, his poverty got better or worse.",63
541,"And the options are increased by 50% increased by 25% remain the same, decreased by 25% decreased by 50%.",105
542,"If you're watching this or listening to this, try to try to vote for yourself.",78
543,70% thought it had gotten worse.,32
544,And that's the general impression.,34
545,88% thought it had gotten worse or remained the same.,53
546,Only 1% thought it decreased by 50%.,36
547,And that is the answer.,23
548,It actually decreased by 50%.,29
549,So only 1% of people got the right optimistic estimate of how poverty is.,73
550,Right.,6
551,And this is the reality.,24
552,And it's true of almost everything you look at.,47
553,You don't want to go back 100 years or 50 years.,48
554,"Things were quite miserable then, but we tend not to remember that.",67
555,"So literacy rate increasing over the past few centuries across all the different nations, nearly to 100% across many of the nations in the world.",145
556,It's gone way up average years of education have gone way up.,61
557,Life expectancy is also increasing.,35
558,Life expectancy was 48 in 1900.,31
559,And it's over 80 now.,21
560,"And it's going to continue to go up, particularly as we get into more advanced stages of simulated biology.",107
561,"For life expectancy, these trends are the same for at birth, age 1, age 5, age 10.",82
562,So it's not just the infer mortality.,37
563,I have 50 more graphs in the book about all kinds of things.,60
564,"Even spread of democracy, which might bring up some controversial issues, it still has gone way up.",99
565,"Well, that one is gone way up, but that one is a bumpy road, right?",67
566,Exactly.,8
567,"And somebody might represent democracy and go backwards, but we basically had no democracies before the creation of the United States, which was a lot of two centuries ago, which is in the scale of human history isn't that long.",228
568,Do you think super intelligent systems will help with democracy?,64
569,So what is democracy?,21
570,Democracy is giving a voice to the populace.,44
571,"And having their ideas, having their beliefs, having their views represented.",77
572,"Well, I hope so.",16
573,"I mean, we've seen social networks can spread conspiracy theories, which have been quite negative, being, for example, being against any kind of stuff that would help your health.",179
574,"So those kinds of ideas have, on social media, you notice is they increase engagement.",86
575,So dramatic division increases engagement.,42
576,Do you worry about AI systems that will learn to maximize that division?,72
577,"I mean, I do have some concerns about this.",43
578,"And I have a chapter on the book about the perils of advanced AI, spreading misinformation on social networks is one of them, but there are many others.",152
579,What's the one that worries you the most?,41
580,That we should think about to try to avoid?,43
581,"Well, it's hard to choose.",26
582,We do have the nuclear power that evolved when I was a child.,61
583,"I remember in, we would actually do these drills against a nuclear war.",71
584,We'd get under our desks and put our hands behind our heads to protect us from a nuclear war.,93
585,Seems to work.,14
586,We're still around.,19
587,"You're protected, but that's still a concern.",45
588,"And there are key, dangerous situations that can take place in biology, someone could create a virus that's very, I mean, we have viruses that are hard to spread and they can be very dangerous.",193
589,"And we have viruses that are easy to spread, but they're not so dangerous.",74
590,Somebody could create something that would be very easy to spread and very dangerous and be very hard to stop.,110
591,"It could be something that would spread without people noticing because people could get it, they'd have no symptoms, and then everybody would get it, and then symptoms would occur maybe a month later.",201
592,"And that actually doesn't occur normally because if we were to have a problem with that, we wouldn't exist.",107
593,So the fact that humans exist means that we don't have viruses that can spread easily and kill us because otherwise we wouldn't exist.,134
594,"Yeah, viruses don't want to do that.",36
595,They want to spread and keep the host alive somewhat.,53
596,"So you can describe various dangers with biology, also nanotechnology, which we actually haven't experienced yet, but there are people that creating nanotechnology and it's carved out in the book.",196
597,"Now you're excited by the possibilities of nanotechnology, of nanobots, of being able to do things inside our body, inside our mind that's going to help.",153
598,What's exciting?,16
599,What's terrifying about nanobots?,33
600,What's exciting is that that's a way to communicate with our neocortex because each neocortex is pretty small and you need a small entity that can actually get in there and establish a communication channel.,207
601,And that's going to really be necessary to connect our brains to AI within ourselves because otherwise it would be hard for us to compete with it.,146
602,"You know, high bandwidth way.",29
603,Yeah.,5
604,And that's key actually because a lot of the things like neural link are really not high bandwidth here.,104
605,So nanobots is the way you achieve high bandwidth.,50
606,How much intelligence would those nanobots have?,48
607,"Yeah, they don't need a lot.",28
608,Just enough to basically establish communication channel to one nanobots.,73
609,So it's primarily about communication between external computing devices and our biological thinking machine.,109
610,What worries you about nanobots?,32
611,Is it similar to the viruses?,29
612,"Well, I mean, that's the great good challenge.",46
613,Yes.,4
614,"If you have a nanobot that wanted to create any kind of entity and repeat itself and was able to operate in a natural environment, you could turn everything into that entity and basically destroy all biological life.",216
615,So you mentioned nuclear weapons.,33
616,Yeah.,5
617,I'd love to hear your opinion about the 21st century and whether you think we might destroy ourselves.,102
618,"And maybe your opinion, if it has changed by looking at what's going on in Ukraine, that we could have a hot war with nuclear powers involved and the tensions building and the seeming forgetting of how terrifying and destructive nuclear weapons are.",249
619,Do you think humans might destroy ourselves in the 21st century and if we do how?,81
620,And how do I avoid it?,22
621,I don't think that's going to happen.,37
622,"Despite the terrors of that war, it is a possibility.",53
623,"But I mean, I don't.",20
624,It's unlikely in your mind.,27
625,Yeah.,5
626,"Even with the tensions we've had with this one, nuclear power plant that's been taken over, it's very tense.",108
627,But I don't actually see a lot of people worrying that that's going to happen.,78
628,I think we'll avoid that.,25
629,We had two nuclear bombs go off in 45.,38
630,"So now we're 70, 7 years later.",31
631,"Yeah, we're doing pretty good.",30
632,We've never had another one go off through anger.,49
633,"People forget, people forget the lessons of history.",52
634,"Well, yeah.",11
635,"I mean, I am worried about it.",30
636,"I mean, that's definitely a challenge.",38
637,But you believe that we'll make it out and ultimately super intelligent AI will help us make it out as opposed to destroy us.,125
638,I think so.,11
639,But we do have to be mindful of these dangers.,46
640,And there are other dangers besides nuclear weapons.,52
641,"So to get back to merging with AI, we'd be able to upload our mind in a computer in a way where we might even transcend the constraints of our bodies.",150
642,So copy our mind into a computer and leave the body behind.,59
643,Let me describe one thing I've already done with my father.,59
644,That's a great story.,21
645,So we created a technology.,27
646,This is public came out six years ago where you could ask any question.,71
647,"And the release product, which I think is still on the market, it would read 200,000 books.",91
648,"And then find the one sentence in 200,000 books that best answered your question.",81
649,It's actually quite interesting.,32
650,You can ask all kinds of questions.,35
651,"And you get the best answer in 200,000 books.",45
652,"But I was also able to take it and not go through 200,000 books, but go through a book that I put together, which is basically everything my father had written.",160
653,"So everything he had written, I had gathered, and we created a book.",68
654,Everything that Frederick Roosevelt had written.,48
655,"Now, I didn't think this actually would work that well because stuff he'd written was stuff about how to lay out.",113
656,"I mean, he did corrected choral groups and music groups.",56
657,"And he would be laying out how the people should, where they should sit and how to fund this.",93
658,And all kinds of things that really weren't didn't seem that interesting.,73
659,"And yet, when you ask a question, it would go through it and it would actually give you a very good answer.",107
660,"So, you know, who's the most interesting composer?",50
661,"And he said, well, definitely Brahms.",37
662,And he would go on about how Brahms was fabulous and talk about the importance of music education.,98
663,"So you could have a conversation with him, which was actually more interesting than talking to him because if you talk to him, he'd be concerned about how they're going to lay out this property to give a choral group.",217
664,He'd be concerned about the day to day versus the big question.,63
665,Exactly.,8
666,"And you did ask about the meaning of life and he answered, love.",64
667,Yeah.,5
668,Do you miss him?,16
669,"Yes, I do.",10
670,You get used to missing somebody after 52 years.,48
671,And I didn't really have intelligent conversations with him until later in life.,80
672,"In the last few years, he was sick, which meant he was home a lot and I was actually able to talk to him about different things like music and other things.",156
673,And so I missed that very much.,31
674,What did you learn about life from your father?,47
675,What part of him is with you now?,33
676,"He was devoted to music and when he would create something to music, he'd put them in a different world.",104
677,"Otherwise, he was very shy.",27
678,"And if people got together, he'd tell it not to interact with people just because of his shyness.",97
679,"But when he created music, he was like a different person.",58
680,Do you have that in you that kind of light that shines?,55
681,"I mean, I got involved with technology at age five.",51
682,And you found love with it in the same way he did with music?,61
683,Yeah.,5
684,I remember this actually happened with my grandmother.,54
685,"She had a manual typewriter and she wrote a book, One Life is Not Enough.",73
686,It's actually a good title for a book.,38
687,"I might write, but it was about a school she had created.",57
688,"Well, actually her mother created it.",37
689,So my mother's mother's mother created the school in 1868.,58
690,And it was the first school in Europe that provided higher education for girls.,79
691,It went through 14th grade.,27
692,"If you were a girl and you were lucky enough to get an education at all, it would go through like 9th grade.",108
693,And many people didn't have any education as a girl.,52
694,This went through 14th grade.,29
695,Her mother created it.,22
696,She took it over.,17
697,And the book was about the history of the school and her involvement with it.,77
698,"When she presented to me, I was not so interested in the story of the of the school.",84
699,But I was totally amazed with this manual typewriter.,53
700,"I mean, here was something you could put a blank piece of paper into and you could turn it into something that looked like it came from a book.",143
701,And you could actually type on it.,34
702,It looked like it came from a book.,35
703,It was just amazing to me.,26
704,And I could see actually how it worked.,39
705,And I was also interested in magic.,35
706,"But in magic, if somebody actually knows how it works, the magic goes away.",75
707,The magic doesn't stay there if you actually understand how it works.,69
708,But he was technology.,22
709,I didn't have that word when I was five or six.,47
710,And the magic was still there for you?,38
711,"The magic was still there, even if you knew how it worked.",58
712,"So I became totally interested in this and then went around, collected little pieces of mechanical objects from bicycles, from broken radios, I would go through the neighborhood.",178
713,This was an era where you would allow five or six year olds to like run through the neighborhood and do this.,109
714,We don't do that anymore.,25
715,But I didn't know how to put them together.,43
716,"I said, if I could just figure out how to put these things together, I could solve any problem.",95
717,"And I actually remember talking to these very old girls, I think they were 10.",78
718,"And telling them, if I could just figure this out, we could fly, we could do anything.",86
719,"And they said, well, you have quite an imagination.",51
720,"And then when I was in third grade, so it was like eight, created like a virtual reality theater where people could come on stage and they could move their arms.",161
721,And all of it was controlled through one control box.,53
722,It was all done with mechanical technology.,43
723,And it was a big hit in my third grade class.,45
724,"And then I went on to do things in junior high school, science fairs and high school science fairs, one of the western science, high school science fairs.",154
725,"So I mean, I became committed to technology when I was five or six years old.",77
726,"You've talked about how you use lucid dreaming to think, to come up with ideas as a source of creativity, because you may be talked through that, maybe the process of how to you've invented a lot of things.",206
727,You've came up and thought through some very interesting ideas.,63
728,"What advice would you give or can you speak to the process of thinking of how to think, how to think creatively?",112
729,"Well, I mean, sometimes I will think through in a dream and try to interpret that.",82
730,But I think the key issue that I would tell younger people is to put yourself in the position that what you're trying to create already exists.,143
731,And then you're explaining how works.,37
732,Exactly.,8
733,That's really interesting.,26
734,You paint a world that you would like to exist.,47
735,You think it exists and reverse it.,35
736,And then you actually imagine you're giving a speech about how you created this.,80
737,"Well, you'd have to then work backwards as to how you would create it and not make it work.",91
738,That's brilliant.,17
739,And that requires some imagination to some first principles thinking.,69
740,You have to visualize that world.,33
741,That's really interesting.,26
742,"And generally, when I talk about things we're trying to invent, I would use the present tense as if it already exists.",118
743,"Not just to give myself that confidence, but everybody else is working on it.",77
744,We just have to kind of do all the steps in order to make it actual.,68
745,How much of a good idea is about timing?,40
746,How much is it about your genius versus that it's time has come?,64
747,Timings are very important.,27
748,That's really why I got into futurism.,38
749,I wasn't inherently a futurist.,31
750,There's not really my goal.,27
751,It's really to figure out when things are feasible.,51
752,We see that now with large scale models.,40
753,"The large scale models like GPT-3, it started two years ago.",60
754,"Four years ago, it wasn't feasible.",35
755,"In fact, they did create GPT-2, which didn't work.",50
756,So it required a certain amount of timing having to do with this exponential growth of computing power.,103
757,So futurism in some sense is a study of timing.,47
758,Trying to understand how the world will evolve.,47
759,Yeah.,5
760,When will the capacity for certain ideas become a thing in itself and to try to time things in the future?,106
761,"But really, it's an original purpose was to tie my products.",60
762,"I mean, it did OCR in the 1970s because OCR doesn't require a lot of computation.",81
763,Optical character recognition.,30
764,So we were able to do that in the 70s.,38
765,I waited till the 80s to address speech recognition since it requires more computation.,87
766,So you were thinking through timing when you're developing those things?,72
767,Has this time come?,19
768,Yeah.,5
769,That's how you've developed that brain power to start to think in a futurist sense when how will the world look like in 2045 and work backwards?,144
770,Yeah.,5
771,And how it gets there.,22
772,But that has to become a thing in itself because looking at what things will be like in the future reflects such dramatic changes in how humans will live.,154
773,That was worth communicating also.,34
774,"So you developed that muscle of predicting the future and then applied broadly and started to discuss how it changes the world of technology, how it changes the world of human life on earth.",190
775,"In Danielle, one of your books, you write about someone who has the courage to question assumptions that limit human imagination to solve problems.",147
776,And you also give advice on how each of us can have this kind of courage.,73
777,"Well, it's good that you picked that quote because I think that that symbolize what Danielle is about courage.",110
778,So how can each of us have that courage to question assumptions?,64
779,"I mean, we see that when people can go beyond the kind realm and create something that's new, I mean, take Uber, for example, before that existed, you never thought that that would be feasible and it did require changes in the way people work.",243
780,Is there practical advice you give in the book about what each of us can do to be a Danielle?,93
781,"Well, she looks at the situation and tries to imagine how she can overcome various obstacles and then she goes for it and she's a very good communicator.",153
782,So she can communicate these ideas to other people.,51
783,"And there's practical advice of learning to program and recording your life and things of this nature, become a physicist.",122
784,So you list a bunch of different suggestions of how to throw yourself into this world.,86
785,"Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a idea how young people can actually change the world by learning all of these different skills.",123
786,"And at the core of that is the belief that you can change the world, that your mind, your body can change the world.",116
787,"Yeah, that's right.",19
788,And not letting anyone else tell you otherwise.,47
789,That's very good.,17
790,Exactly.,8
791,"When we upload the story you told about your dad and having a conversation with him, we're talking about uploading your mind to the computer.",141
792,Do you think we'll have a future with something you call afterlife?,67
793,"We'll have avatars and mimic increasingly better and better our behavior, our appearance, all that kind of stuff.",113
794,Even those are perhaps not no longer with us.,45
795,"Yes, I mean, we need some information about them.",49
796,"I mean, I think about my father.",32
797,I have what he wrote.,21
798,"Now, he didn't have a word processor.",37
799,So he didn't actually write that much.,38
800,And our memories of him aren't perfect.,39
801,So how do you even know if you've created something that's satisfactory?,72
802,"Now, you could do a Frederick Kurzweil Turing test.",51
803,It seems like Frederick Kurzweil to me.,39
804,But the people who remember him like me don't have a perfect memory.,68
805,Is there such a thing as a perfect memory?,42
806,Maybe the whole point is for him to make you feel a certain way.,64
807,Yeah.,5
808,"Well, I think that would be the call.",37
809,That's the connection we have with loved ones.,46
810,It's not really based on very strict definition of truth.,57
811,It's more about the experiences we share.,41
812,And they get more through memory.,33
813,But ultimately they make a smile.,33
814,I think we definitely can do that.,34
815,And that would be very worthwhile.,34
816,So do you think we'll have a world of replicants of copies?,59
817,There'll be a bunch of records as well.,39
818,Like I could hang out with one.,31
819,"I can download it for five books and have a best friend, Ray.",61
820,"And you, the original copy wouldn't even know about it.",55
821,Is that you think that world is first of all do you think that world is feasible?,81
822,And do you think there's ethical challenges there?,50
823,Like how would you feel about me hanging out with Ray Kurzweil?,63
824,And you're not knowing about it.,32
825,Just strike me as a problem.,28
826,Which you?,10
827,What original?,14
828,Would you strike with that cause a problem for you?,51
829,"No, I enjoy.",12
830,I would really very much enjoy it.,34
831,"No, not just hanging out with me, but if somebody hanging out with you, a replicant of you.",91
832,"Well, I think I would start.",28
833,It sounds exciting.,19
834,But then what if they start doing better than me and take over my friend group?,79
835,"And then because they may be an imperfect copy, or there may be more social or all these kinds of things.",105
836,And then I become like the old version that's not nearly as exciting.,69
837,Maybe there are copies of the best version of me on a good day.,63
838,Yeah.,5
839,"But if you hang out with a replicant of me, and that turned out to be successful, I'd feel proud of that person because it was based on me.",139
840,"So it's, but it is a kind of death of this version of you.",58
841,"Well, not necessarily.",22
842,"I mean, you can still be alive, right?",38
843,"But, and you would be proud.",28
844,"Okay, so it's like having kids and you're proud that they've done even more than you were able to do.",101
845,"Yeah, exactly.",14
846,"It does bring up new issues, but it seems like an opportunity.",62
847,"Well, that replicant should probably have the same rights as you do.",68
848,"Well, that gets into a whole issue because when a replicant occurs, they're not necessarily going to have your rights.",118
849,"And if a replicant occurs to somebody who's already dead, do they have all the obligations and that the original person had?",124
850,Do they have all the agreements that they had?,46
851,So I think you're going to have to have laws that say yes.,58
852,"There has to be, if you want to create a replicant, they have to have all the same rights as human rights.",106
853,"Well, you don't know.",21
854,So I'm going to create a replicant.,35
855,"Say, well, it's a replicant, but I didn't bother getting their rights.",70
856,"And so, but that would be illegal.",34
857,"I mean, like if you do that, you have to do that in the black market.",69
858,"Yes, if you want to get an official replicant, that's not so easy.",66
859,It's supposed to create multiple replicants.,44
860,"The original rights, maybe for one person and not for a whole group of people.",78
861,Sure.,5
862,So there has to be at least one.,32
863,And then all the other ones kind of share the rights.,53
864,"Yeah, I just don't think that that's very difficult to conceive for us humans.",78
865,"The idea that we don't create a replicant that has certain, I mean, I've talked to people about this, including my wife, who would look like to get back her father.",164
866,And she doesn't worry about who has rights to watch.,52
867,She should have somebody that she could visit with and give her some satisfaction.,82
868,And she wouldn't care about any of these other rights.,54
869,What does your wife think about multiple reykers as well?,57
870,Have you had that discussion?,29
871,I've run the dress that weather.,32
872,But I think ultimately that's an important question.,52
873,"Loved ones, how they feel about.",32
874,There's something about love.,29
875,"Well, that's the key thing, right?",34
876,"If the loved ones rejected, it's not going to work very well.",61
877,"So the loved ones really are the key determinant, whether or not this works or not.",83
878,But there's also ethical rules.,31
879,We have to contend with the idea.,33
880,And we have to contend with that idea with AI.,46
881,"But what's going to motivate it is, I mean, I talk to people who really miss people who are gone and they would love to get something back, even if it isn't perfect.",165
882,And that's what's going to motivate this.,41
883,And that person lives on in some form.,38
884,"And the more data we have, the more we're able to reconstruct that person.",74
885,And a lot than to live on.,26
886,"Eventually, as we go forward, we're going to have more and more of this data, because we're going to have none of us that are inside our neocortex.",147
887,We're going to collect a lot of data.,37
888,"In fact, anything that's data is always collected.",50
889,"There is something a little bit sad, which is becoming or maybe it's hopeful, which is more and more common these days, which when a person passes away, you have their Twitter account.",184
890,"And you have the last tweet they tweeted, like something they can do.",69
891,And you can recreate them now with large language models and so on.,67
892,"I mean, you can create somebody that's just like them and can actually continue and communicate.",96
893,"I think that's really exciting, because I think in some sense, like if I were to die today, in some sense, I would continue on if I continued tweeting.",151
894,"I tweet, therefore I am.",24
895,"Yeah, well, I mean, that's one of the advantages of a replicant that I can recreate the communications of that person.",118
896,"Do you hope, do you think do you hope humans will become a multi-planetary species?",83
897,"You've talked about the phases, the six epochs, and one of them is reaching out into the stars, in part.",104
898,"Yes, but the kind of attempts for making now to go to other planetary objects doesn't excite me that much, because it's not really advancing anything.",150
899,It's not efficient enough?,26
900,"Yeah, we're also putting out other human beings, which is a very inefficient way to explore these other objects.",112
901,"But I'm really talking about in the six-step universe wakes up, it's where we can spread our superintelligence throughout the universe, and that doesn't mean sending a very soft squishy creatures like humans.",208
902,The universe wakes up.,22
903,"I mean, we would send intelligence masses of nanobots, which can then go out and colonize these other parts of the universe.",124
904,Do you think there is intelligent alien civilizations out there that our bots might meet?,89
905,My hunch is no.,15
906,"Most people say yes, absolutely.",32
907,"I mean, the universe is too big, and they'll cite the Drake equation.",69
908,"And I think in singularities near, I have two analyses of the Drake equation, both with very reasonable assumptions, and one gives you thousands of advanced civilizations in each galaxy, and another one gives you one civilization, and we know of one.",250
909,"A lot of the analyses are forgetting the exponential growth of computation, because we've gone from where the fastest way I could send a message to somebody was with a pony, which was what, like a century and a half ago?",220
910,"To the advanced civilization we have today, and if you've accepted what I've said, go forward a few decades.",108
911,"You can have absolutely fantastic amount of civilization compared to a pony, and that's in a couple hundred years.",114
912,The speed and the scale of information transfer is growing exponentially.,73
913,"So, I think I'll blink of an eye.",33
914,"Now, think about these other civilizations.",43
915,They're going to be spread out at cosmic times.,47
916,"So, if something is like ahead of us or behind us, it could be ahead of us or behind us by maybe millions of years, which isn't that much.",138
917,"I mean, the world's billions of years old, 14 billion or something.",67
918,"So, even a thousand years, if two or three hundred years is enough to go from a pony to a fantastic amount of civilization, we would see that.",142
919,"So, of other civilizations that have occurred, some might be behind us, but some might be ahead of us.",102
920,"If they're ahead of us, they're ahead of us by thousands, millions of years, and there'd be so far beyond us, they would be doing galaxy-wide engineering.",154
921,But we don't see anything doing galaxy-wide engineering.,56
922,"So, either they don't exist or this very universe is a construction of an alien species.",88
923,We're living inside a video game.,33
924,"Well, that's another explanation that, yes, you've got some teenage kids in other civilizations.",96
925,Do you find compelling the simulation hypothesis as a thought experiment that we're living in a simulation?,107
926,The universe is computational.,30
927,"So, we are an example in a computational world.",47
928,"Therefore, it is a simulation.",30
929,"It doesn't necessarily mean an experiment by some high school kid in another world, but nonetheless, it's taking place in a computational world.",144
930,And everything that's going on is basically a form of computation.,66
931,"So, you really have to define what you mean by this whole world being a simulation.",83
932,"Well, then it's the teenager that makes the video game.",55
933,Us humans with our current limited cognitive capability have strived to understand ourselves and we have created religions.,123
934,We think of God.,16
935,"Whatever that is, do you think God exists?",42
936,"And if so, who is God?",22
937,I alluded to this before.,25
938,We started out with lots of particles going around.,51
939,And there's nothing that represents love and creativity.,56
940,"In summer, we've got into a world where love actually exists and then has to do actually with consciousness because you can't have love without consciousness.",158
941,"So, to me, that's God.",22
942,The fact that we have something where love where you can be devoted to someone else and really feel that love that's God.,121
943,"And if you look at the Old Testament, it was actually created by several different ribonets in there.",101
944,And I think they've identified three of them.,45
945,One of them dealt with God as a person that you can make deals with and he gets angry and he wrecks vengeance on various people.,128
946,But two of them actually talk about God as a symbol of love and peace and harmony and so forth.,95
947,That's how they describe God.,29
948,"So, that's my view of God.",26
949,Not as a person in the sky that you can make deals with.,56
950,It's whatever the magic that goes from basic elements to things that consciousness and love.,92
951,"Do you think one of the things I find extremely beautiful and powerful is cellular automata, which you also touch on?",117
952,"Do you think whatever the heck happens in cellular automata where interesting complicated objects emerge, God is in there too.",126
953,The emergence of love in this seemingly perfected universe of creating a replicate is that they would love you and you would love them.,135
954,There wouldn't be much point of doing it if that didn't happen.,63
955,"But all of it, I guess what I'm saying about cellular automata is it's a primitive building blocks and they somehow create beautiful things.",140
956,Is there some deep truth to that about how our universe works?,62
957,"Is the emergence from simple rules, beautiful complex objects can emerge?",73
958,Is that the thing that made us as we went through all the six phases of reality?,80
959,That's a good way to look at it.,32
960,It just makes some point to the whole value of having a universe.,65
961,Do you think about your own mortality?,38
962,Are you afraid of it?,21
963,"Yes, but I keep going back to my idea of being able to expand human life quickly enough in advance of how we're getting there longevity escape velocity.",152
964,"Which we're not quite at yet, but I think we're actually pretty close, particularly with, for example, doing simulated biology.",127
965,"I think we can probably get there within, say, by the end of this decade.",73
966,And that's my goal.,19
967,Do you hope to achieve the longevity escape velocity?,53
968,Do you hope to achieve immortality?,35
969,"Well, immortality is hard to say.",33
970,"I can't really come on your program saying, I've done it.",57
971,I've achieved immortality because it's never forever.,53
972,"A long time, a long time of living well.",40
973,"But we'd like to actually advance human like expectancy, advance my life expectancy more than a year, every year.",113
974,I think we can get there within by the end of this decade.,58
975,How do you think we'd do it?,28
976,So there's practical things in transcend the nine steps to living well forever your book.,89
977,You describe just that.,23
978,"There's practical things like health, exercise, all those things.",65
979,"I mean, we live in a body that doesn't last forever.",52
980,"There's no reason why it can't, though.",39
981,And we're discovering things that I think that will extend it.,62
982,"But you do have to deal with, I mean, I've got various issues.",62
983,"Went to Mexico 40 years ago, developed Salmanella, they created pancreatitis, which gave me a strange form of diabetes.",119
984,It's not type one diabetes because it's an autoimmune disorder that destroys your pancreas.,91
985,I don't have that.,18
986,"But it's also not type two diabetes because type two diabetes is your pancreas works fine, but your cells start to absorb the insulin well.",139
987,I don't have that either.,25
988,"The pancreatitis I had partially damaged my pancreas, but it was a one-time thing.",82
989,It didn't continue.,19
990,And I've learned now how to control it.,39
991,But so that's just something that I had to do in order to continue to exist.,76
992,This is your particular biological system.,42
993,"You have to figure out a few hacks and the ideas that science would need to do that much better, actually.",106
994,"So I mean, I do spend a lot of time just tinkering with my own body to keep it going.",85
995,So I do think I'll last till the end of this decade.,52
996,And I think we'll achieve longevity escape velocity.,52
997,I think that we'll start with people who are very diligent about this.,70
998,Eventually it will become sort of routine that people will be able to do it.,76
999,"So if you're talking about kids today or even people in their 20s or 30s, it's really not a very serious problem.",113
1000,"I've had some discussions with relatives who were like almost a hundred and saying, well, we're working on it as quickly as possible.",133
1001,I don't know if that's going to work.,37
1002,Is there a case?,16
1003,This is a difficult question.,29
1004,"But is there a case to be made against living forever that a finite life, that mortality is a feature, not a bug, that living a short or so dying makes ice cream taste delicious, makes life intensely beautiful more than, uh, most people believe that way, except if you present a death of anybody they care about or love, they find that extremely depressing.",357
1005,"And I know people who feel that way, 20, 30, 40 years later, they still want them back.",87
1006,So I mean death is not something to celebrate.,46
1007,But we've lived in a world where people just accept this.,57
1008,"Well, life is short.",20
1009,"You see it all the time on TV, life's short, you have to take advantage of it.",78
1010,And nobody accepts the fact that you could actually go beyond normal lifetimes.,79
