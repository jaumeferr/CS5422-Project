0," The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio, his second time on the podcast.",80
1,"He is a legendary investor, founder of Bridgewater Associates, author of a book I highly recommend called Principles and also a new book called Principles for Dealing with a Changing World Order that looks at the geopolitics of the day, especially US and China, to the lens of history, providing a fascinating model for the rise and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.",404
2,This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it.,47
3,Please check out our sponsors in the description.,49
4,And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.,46
5,"When you look at the history of the world, as you have done in your new book, Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order, what is more important, more impactful, money or power?",184
6,They go hand in hand.,21
7,They support each other and they compete with each other.,57
8,"Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.",57
9,"That power has to do with all that they can buy, but it also has the ability to influence those with political power.",117
10,"So you see this throughout history, this symbiotic relationship, for example, between the royal families and the nobility and the church.",137
11,So you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways and then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group.,153
12,"So the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power back in the 16th, 17th centuries.",111
13,"You would look at royal families, nobles and the church, if you're in Europe, and then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic.",155
14,And that varies over time.,26
15,It changes.,11
16,"As those people get thrown out in technology changes, so when we evolved, when the society evolved, so that it would produce goods and services, and you have something like the Industrial Revolution, the first Industrial Revolution.",232
17,"They have machines, and you have the talent of people that are off the farms, and then you have a struggling for power.",119
18,You see that power mix change.,30
19,"And so we don't see that same power mix anymore, but you still see the same dynamic.",84
20,"You see those with money, dealing with those who have political power around those assets that are considered most valuable to particularly the productive assets that produce money.",181
21,"And political powers usually centered around nation state, so the major locuses of powers the nations.",102
22,"Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war, there was the development of nation states.",80
23,"Before then, we had, I was really the development of countries as we know it, that there were borders, and that within those borders, those who had control, got to control it, and there would not be intrusions in those borders, and that's how we established the nation state.",275
24,"And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.",58
25,"There is a central level, and then there is a typically a province or state level down below, and then there's a municipal level, so they each have different levels of power, and it's the coordination of those that determines how the country is run.",249
26,"You write that the quote archetypal, big cycle, governs the rising and declining empires and influences everything about them, including their currencies and markets.",166
27,"The most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction, the long term debt and capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, and the external order and disorder cycle.",206
28,Can you describe this big cycle?,32
29,There are two orders.,21
30,"There is an order by a system, order, I mean, a system, how the system works.",77
31,"So there's an internal order, that is the internal governance system, and it's usually set out in a constitution or some agreements, and then there's the world order, how the world system, so for example, in 1945 at the end of a war, which is basically a fight for determining the world order, the winners of the fight got together and created the world system as we now know it.",379
32,"44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system that determined the money pretty much, and because the United States won and had 80% of the world's money, gold was money then, and it has 80% of the world's gold, and it was half the world's economy, and it was the great military power.",288
33,"The water was built around an American world order, so that the United Nations was in New York, the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington, and they built that new water.",173
34,"So, classically, you have a war to determine whose rules were following, and then you have the new water being constructed.",123
35,"After that, there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity, peace suits prosperity, and so there's not, and the reason you have the peace is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.",205
36,"You know you're going to lose, you've surrendered, there's been the surrendering.",81
37,"They carve up the world, they say what it's going to look like, who's going to control what, and then you come into that period of peace and then prosperity, where then there's a working together.",196
38,"Usually at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt, you've wiped out a lot of the issues, the class warfare, and so on, and then there's good working together.",166
39,"So those great periods, such as the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, or what we've experienced in the post-World War II period are peaceful and prosperous periods led largely by the dominant world power.",211
40,"Over a period of time, since really 1500, and maybe before, but really 1500 when the Dutch invented capitalism, and what I mean by that, they invented the first capital markets, the first stocks and the first stock market, that since then capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources into the hands of inventive people.",357
41,"That's when we moved from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people, they got resources, and then they built that prosperity.",140
42,"In that process of doing that, they create wealth gaps naturally.",65
43,"Those who make a lot of money make a lot more, and then those that don't.",73
44,"And it also produces opportunity gaps because, for example, those who earn a lot of money have that wealth, they have the power to educate their children in a way that others don't, and the gaps grow.",200
45,And also the debts grow at that time.,37
46,"When they go around the world with their competitiveness, they earn a lot of money.",83
47,"So, for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire, learned how to build ships that would go around the world.",104
48,A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education.,83
49,"And by education, I mean the skills that come from education, but also civility, the ability to deal well together.",115
50,"So, the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world, and they had military power, but they were also very inventive society.",132
51,25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.,54
52,"And so as they went around the world, they also brought their currency, and they brought their military.",104
53,"They needed the currency, they paid for things and that currency, and then the more that happens, the more that becomes a reserve currency.",139
54,"And then they have their military, so they need their military strength.",72
55,And so you see it evolved in all of those ways.,47
56,"But over a period of time, as they become more successful and more expensive, they become more expensive.",105
57,"And newer countries come along, like the UK, then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch, and could do that less expensively.",128
58,"And also when they become more expensive, so less competitive, and also the work ethic begins to change.",104
59,"They believe that since they're richer, they can enjoy life more.",65
60,They don't have to work quite as hard.,38
61,And so you start to see the tilt.,33
62,Now you start to see the development of the top.,48
63,"And when you have a world reserve currency, that allows you to borrow a lot of money, because those who want to save, want to hold your money, and that means that they'll lend you money.",186
64,And so those countries get deeper into debt.,44
65,So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness.,58
66,"And they get themselves into financial circumstances, which are not good.",73
67,"And they have large wealth gaps, which set the stage for downturns.",67
68,"And when they have downturns, the first question is, do they have enough money?",79
69,"And traditionally, money is resources.",38
70,So you classically see that the coffers are bare.,49
71,That they're spending more money than they are earning.,55
72,And they run out of money in the coffers.,41
73,"And their graineries are empty, rather than stocked, so that they give them the buffer.",87
74,"And as that deteriorates, that that worsens conditions.",55
75,"And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them, they see greater internal conflict over wealth.",108
76,"And then they have the problems internally, and the problems externally, which usually results in an internal war, or an external war, that leads to the change in the new world order.",183
77,"And do you, the Dutch Empire, is a good example that the British, what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book of this process that follow the big cycle?",175
78,"Well, the leading reserve currency empires, but it applies to all the empires, were the Dutch, the British, the American, and the Chinese.",138
79,But you could follow the same pattern.,38
80,"In the book, it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts, because that's subjective.",104
81,It was very important for me to use actual measurements.,56
82,"So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.",59
83,You can see where's the education level.,40
84,What is the military power?,27
85,"Each one of those, and you can see the back going over the 500 years.",69
86,And so you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs.,62
87,"And what you see is really in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that.",82
88,But you also can see through those numbers the health of those countries.,73
89,"Today, there are statistics that you could, that are in the book, that show what is the level of education?",107
90,What is the level of economic output?,37
91,What is the level of military strength?,39
92,What is the level of a number of different measures of strength so that you can then compare that?,98
93,"And I think that because they're objective measures of strength that you could see change, that shows the picture of where we are today.",136
94,And I think one of the most important things about the book is that it allows people to monitor how those things are transpiring.,129
95,"I think for policymakers, you know, are your policymakers doing a good job?",75
96,And there's so much subjectivity in that.,41
97,But I think it's very simple.,29
98,"If those lines on the chart are improving, if your health index is improving, then you're moving toward a better life.",118
99,So that's what the book works like.,35
100,"Also, it was used to create a model for the future.",51
101,"In other words, there are cause-effect relationships.",53
102,"Everything that happens has reasons, causes that preceded it, that made it happen.",82
103,"And so by having all those in numbers, one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.",97
104,So that's what you see in the book.,35
105,"It's not just, you know, raise interpretation.",46
106,I didn't want to make it raise interpretation because I don't know if I'm right.,80
107,Yeah.,5
108,"So one of the fascinating things in the books, you have lists these 18 measures.",80
109,And there's like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today.,73
110,"So let's say, US, China, and Europe.",36
111,"And what it was 20 years ago, and looking at the change from 20 years ago, and that's another indicator, the change itself, to see where things are headed.",155
112,"Maybe can you comment on from a score perspective, how is US and China doing?",77
113,"And in the 18 measures, what are some measures that stand out to you?",69
114,"It was particularly important to think about today for the United States, for China.",84
115,"Well, there are a number.",25
116,"Financially, what you see in the United States is that we're borrowing a lot more money, creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.",147
117,"And our capacity to do that is very much, is limited, first of all, because when there's a sale of a bond, when the government borrows more than it borrows money because it spends more than it takes in, you have to sell a bond.",227
118,"And the world right now has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds because as the world's reserve currency, they sell, sold on them.",130
119,"And they have very bad returns, negative real returns, negative real returns significantly, and so on.",102
120,So that means that more bonds has to be sold than are bought.,61
121,"And that means that the Federal Reserve has faced with the choice of having to raise the interest rate to curtail borrowing, which slows the economy and hurts the markets, or by filling that difference, and producing money, the debt monetization, which produces an inflation in goods, services, and financial assets.",316
122,"So in that regard, that's the United States' position.",54
123,"In China's case, its balance of payments is better.",51
124,China has displaced the United States as the world's largest trading country.,77
125,"In other words, more exports to other countries.",48
126,"And as a result, it's economically competitive, but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.",97
127,It's a real blessing.,21
128,"So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency, but it is risking it because of this imbalance.",106
129,"So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly, but when they go eventually, they go quickly.",102
130,So there's a risk of that financially.,38
131,Then there's the issue of internal order.,41
132,"So I'm just giving you the major ones, but I'll get into some of the other ones too.",84
133,"Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict in the United States, which affects how well it works.",100
134,"In China, there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state, but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is economic in terms of producing that prosperity.",201
135,"So if you stay out of the politics pretty much, then you're seeing entrepreneurship, you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.",140
136,"So that internal working, that's subject to different people's interpretations, whether they like it or not, but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures is less.",179
137,Sorry to pause on that for a second.,36
138,"So these measures, I guess you don't want to romanticize anyone measure or something like that overinterpret anyone measure.",124
139,Is internal conflict always a bad thing?,40
140,Is it a complicated calculation?,32
141,Or do you kind of the way we think about these measures that you've presented we should be thinking like the higher the better the lower the worse or depending on the better.,174
142,"Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces the revolution produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions that and lead to new starts.",147
143,And so a short term civil war is a hellacious experience.,57
144,"And at the same time, it can be the transition to a new beginning.",66
145,"Also, there are different types of conflict.",44
146,"Competition, which makes things, makes everything better is a productive conflict, whereas destructive conflicts are not good over the short time.",146
147,So that's how those go.,23
148,"So within each measure, the story is complicated.",49
149,"But my measures are sort of clear, meaning how much political conflict, how much social conflict, another, you can measure conflict, you can measure fighting, you can measure crime rates, you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.",239
150,So the measures are a composite of different types of internal conflict.,72
151,What is some other interesting measures?,40
152,Maybe you can also mention like from me in particular interest is education and innovation.,91
153,"Yes, the classic cycle, the most important leading indicator is the quality of education.",89
154,"Most importantly, broad-based education drawn from the largest population because you can never tell who the talent is going to be.",131
155,Where are they going to come from?,34
156,"So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties, the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach, it was merit to credit of everybody could sit for exams and so on, broad-based of drawing in the populations.",219
157,And you see that if you go across societies because that draws on the largest number of population to get education.,116
158,"And it also, that creates a reality and a perception that the system is fairer equal opportunity, not just one of privilege, and that helps to create social stability.",167
159,"But education is not just education in understanding facts and so on, it is education in civility of how to behave together.",124
160,"And so if they're smart, they understand how to be productive because they work well together and they're productive.",117
161,And then that leads to the next stage.,38
162,"You can see in the lines and the charts, I plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle, you could see that education is the long leading indicator.",158
163,"And then you could see, as you mentioned, that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures, then follow.",114
164,"And you see, then also competitiveness and world markets follows.",65
165,"For example, in the early stages of a cycle, the industries that they go into tend to be very basic industry because they have cheap labor, something like textiles and simple manufactured goods and so on.",204
166,"But as the education rises, then they move up the value chain to tech greater technologies and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity.",147
167,"So yes, those, as you say, there are 18 different measures like that, but education and then civility and the inventiveness.",124
168,"So you see it reflected in, in who's inventing what?",52
169,And that corresponds then who's trading with who's a big trading country?,73
170,And where's the value of economic output and what a per capita income?,70
171,They all follow follow those arcs.,34
172,"Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book, so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots.",117
173,"Yeah, you can see it.",21
174,It's not just your opinion.,27
175,"It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like, but you're just giving a lot of of your own insights along with the numbers.",136
176,"If you were to look at the American nation, the American empire and the trajectory is looking into the future, given these measures, what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of the American empire based on these measures?",230
177,"What are the concerning indicators and if those break down further, what does that look like?",93
178,"Well, all of those indicators are concerning.",45
179,"Maybe except for one, which is technology, the technology niche, although even in that area of the United States is improving at a slower rate than is China for various advantages that they have there.",201
180,"They put out about eight times as many computer engineers, they have free data and so on.",89
181,"But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern.",55
182,The internal order disorder is a concern.,41
183,"Then if you look at education levels, the United States is losing its educational advantage.",92
184,"If you were to look at compare it with China, if you take general public education in the United States, it's deteriorated tremendously even in comparison to developed countries.",178
185,"There are scores, pieces scores and so on and something like 38th in the world or something and that was a big plunge, average public education.",144
186,"If you look at the best universities in the world, the United States is unique in having the best universities in the world.",124
187,"So there are these privileged spots that are excellent, uniquely excellent.",75
188,"So when you look at the comparison, education in China is improving rapidly and the quantity of educated people in the areas that they're moving in are greater and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater.",220
189,You see the results are greater.,32
190,But it's a long line that I'm dealing with.,43
191,"If you would have followed through in terms of actual productions, I think you know, in terms of technologies, there are some areas that the United States is in a lead at the moment.",182
192,"There are some areas that China is in a lead, but China's gaining very quickly.",79
193,"When I first went to China, 1984, I would bring $10 calculators and I gave them ways of gifts to high ranking people and they thought they were miracle devices.",160
194,"Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing and AI and you know, many areas, you have a race going on.",110
195,"And so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness, not just look at the current level, you have a situation where they're improving at a much faster rate.",161
196,This is all good for the world if the world can get along.,58
197,"And the main thing I think is in just an, how do you have a healthy world and how do you have a strong economy and how do you have a strong situation is be strong.",163
198,The United States is war is with itself.,40
199,That's the main war.,20
200,"You know, it's very simple in history.",38
201,The financially sound earn more than you spend and be strong in these ways and pretty much everything will take care of itself.,127
202,"But you make it sound simple, of course, because there's a momentum when things degrade, when the education system degrades, when you start borrowing, when I mean all of these indicators, they're going down, there's a momentum to it, right?",240
203,So it's hard to reverse it.,27
204,Right.,6
205,And there are circumstances that you're then in.,48
206,"For example, indebtedness, you know, it's politically desirable for those in tomorrow money and spend because their constituencies only look at what they get.",158
207,"And when they get a lot, they don't pay attention to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books.",105
208,"So it's always better to borrow, spend, and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.",83
209,And so you inherit a lot.,25
210,You inherited a new president enters in or new legislators.,59
211,They have a lot of debt.,24
212,They have a broken down infrastructure.,39
213,They don't have enough money to fix that.,41
214,And so that's the lay of the land that the prior generations put you in.,72
215,And there you are.,18
216,And so that's right.,20
217,"It's difficult because when you start to think, okay, what's healthy?",69
218,"Well, spend, earn more than you spend.",38
219,"Well, that's not so easy because, you know, what does that mean?",64
220,Go earn more.,13
221,"I mean, okay, that's not so easy.",33
222,Spend less.,11
223,That isn't going to work.,25
224,So now what do you do?,22
225,"Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize.",48
226,And that's why it's classic.,28
227,"So yes, that's why these cycles occur because what has created before what happened before created the lay of the land that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.",168
228,So what can great leaders do in this moment?,44
229,"I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here.",53
230,"So for example, to do very large projects that invest in the education system that sort of try to fix the fundamentals or maybe invest more and more into the innovation and the development of new technologies and so on.",219
231,It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.,51
232,So you have to have strong leaders that convince the populists of the importance of these ideas.,96
233,"Well, I completely agree with your list.",40
234,What we have is a situation where everybody has their opinions and they have to sort of get them exactly right and they all fight with each other about whether they're opinions.,177
235,So the most important thing is that we are become bipartisan so that we don't and we get over our differences.,110
236,I would have a bipartisan cabinet.,34
237,"I would draw upon both members of both parties, the moderates who are going to be able to work together.",104
238,So as then we have one country and then we deal with those in a means that works for the majority of the people in the middle rather than the polarity.,151
239,I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.,58
240,"So I would say that's a paramount importance because we have the resources, wealth, real wealth and science and everything has never been better than it is.",156
241,But the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people and we have to keep it being productive.,105
242,So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together so that they increase the size of the pie and they create broad-based prosperity.,145
243,So that is a paramount importance.,34
244,"Whatever they do, if they do it that way, I can say I'm happy about because that other alternative is the really scary alternative.",131
245,"The scary alternative, the different ways it has evolved throughout history, some of it has led to wars.",104
246,What are the future trajectories that lead to a potential war with China?,73
247,Cold War or hot war?,20
248,Is this something you think about?,34
249,Is this something you're worried about?,39
250,"Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.",39
251,"So the war with China, as I say, there are five kinds of wars.",62
252,"There is a trade war technology war, geopolitical influence war, capital war and military war.",94
253,"As far as military war goes, I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue.",86
254,We could talk about that for a minute.,38
255,"But those others, there'll be rough competitions and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.",109
256,That's what that war looks like.,32
257,Taiwan has been for a long time a sovereignty issue to China.,61
258,And it has its roots in what's called the Hundred Years of Humiliation.,71
259,"From the 1840s to 1949 foreign powers came in, took advantage of China.",71
260,They had the opium wars such times.,35
261,And that represented the Hundred Years of Humiliation.,54
262,And Taiwan represents their sovereignty and their important thing.,66
263,"And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago, there was an agreement that there is one China.",88
264,And Taiwan is part of China.,28
265,And that there would be peaceful reunification.,47
266,The peaceful reunification hasn't happened.,43
267,"And in their view, that's a very big issue.",43
268,And so it's a big contentious issue.,36
269,And that could produce a military war.,38
270,Could produce a military accident.,34
271,Could produce a very tense situation.,37
272,"And if we had a military war, God help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict harm on each other.",122
273,"But anyway, that's that's that.",31
274,"If you don't have that military war, you'll have the competition between those other kinds of wars.",99
275,And whoever is strongest in those areas will win.,49
276,Where do you put cyber war within the five?,43
277,"Well, cyber war is a military war.",34
278,I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're referring to is that which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber.,133
279,"So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war, you could see space war, you can see drone warfare, you new types of warfare, not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare.",168
280,But you could see any of the above.,35
281,What are the defining characteristics?,38
282,"What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping, the president of China as a leader on the world stage?",104
283,His father was a early leader.,30
284,He was himself in the culture of evolution in times treated brutally.,69
285,"And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.",60
286,And he came up through the ranks and is a very intelligent man.,63
287,"When he first came to power, they, as you know, they have two five-year terms.",78
288,And we're now coming to the end of the second of those five-year terms.,71
289,"When he first came to power, he felt that there should be a lot of reform and reform meant moving to much more of a market and open economy.",140
290,"When that happened in him coming in, I had some contact with economic policy makers, but in the circumstances then were that five major banks lent a state on end to prizes and local governments with implied government guarantees.",229
291,And so there was not control of that.,37
292,And the movement to a more of a market economy.,47
293,And the development of markets was a primary.,45
294,And also the dealing with the corruption issue.,47
295,There was a lot of corruption prior to that.,44
296,And that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.,59
297,So that became the primary objective.,37
298,"And then as time progressed over those 10 years, there was a lot of changing in the world.",90
299,"Their financial circumstances opening many, many other markets.",63
300,They particularly getting money to small and medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it.,139
301,"So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets.",48
302,You can raise capital.,22
303,You can be an entrepreneur.,27
304,You can become a billionaire in the capital markets.,52
305,And they develop the markets to be the second largest capital markets.,70
306,"At the same time, they had to deal with their rising debt issue, which they began to deal with really about four years ago when the second term began.",150
307,And then Luhua became the vice premier responsible for that and to deal with those issues.,90
308,So you see right now that what's happening is the dealing with the real estate bubble.,86
309,"There was a development in real estate, a bubble, which produced a lot of unproductive lending.",95
310,"And Shishi Ping said, houses are meant to live in, not to speculate on.",71
311,And so that was wasteful.,25
312,"So they established what they call three red lines, which are financial ratios, that the property developers had to live within.",128
313,"And that is then causing the adjustments that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on, the most in the public thing, okay, that's a problem.",200
314,It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts and bad practices.,71
315,And so that's what's going on.,30
316,So that's let's say economically.,33
317,"At the same time, there is the changing relationships, the changing world order, the changing relationships with the United States and other countries, which is becoming much less cooperative and much more warlike, much more confrontational.",241
318,"Those two things, the domestic debt problem and the domestic has led to what's called core, what they call core leadership, which means a leadership more around him that is less challenging because they believe in history that during very difficult times a more centrally controlled decision making process lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project.",383
319,And that's basically what's going on now.,41
320,"You said it very eloquently, but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men and there's a lot of centralized control.",123
321,"That characterization is, is much more black and white than it really is.",73
322,But it leans towards that direction.,36
323,"Like for example, of the standing members of the Politburo four are more alleged, allied him three or less.",107
324,So you have to understand that it's kind of a collective leadership at the top.,79
325,"And then of course, there's just jockeying for power, you know, in a highly political sense at the top.",103
326,But no one leader can be successful against the all those powers at the top.,76
327,So it's very politically negotiating.,37
328,"It's very much more like if you put in the United States, the Democrats and the Republicans, and they had to be in the same government and they work it out.",156
329,It's kind of something like that.,33
330,And then so that's that struggle.,33
331,But it's an internal struggle.,30
332,"Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the United States when then now we're talking about that at the context of China, the freedom of speech, freedoms.",188
333,"What China is doing with the central management of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth.",98
334,"But it's also limiting people on the very basic level in terms of freedom, the kind of freedom that I think can lead to entrepreneurship to starting new businesses, to having big dreams and chasing those dreams and then creating totally new things in whatever the space, maybe in technology and in business and whatever.",320
335,How important is that as a metric for society?,46
336,"Well, they have a view in which is the idea of a dialectic which means that two things are at obvious, that everything comes with pros and cons and two opposites exist.",168
337,And you want the benefits of those two opposites and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites.,110
338,"So it let's say you want the capital markets because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are motivated, they build fortunes and that drives an economy to do very well.",185
339,"And at the same time it produces the other problems, the wealth gaps, the other problems, the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.",140
340,"And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism and the market economy and the capital markets?",97
341,"And he famously said, and if it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat just as long as it catches mice.",114
342,"In other words, if it works and make in the country richer, then that becomes the objective and then they move that along.",122
343,So there are these conflicts and one of the leaders described it to me as follows because it's confusion and it goes back over a period of time.,144
344,There's a hierarchy and it's an extension of the family he described it.,72
345,"And he said, the United States is a country of individuals and individualism.",77
346,And that is its vibrancy that we see.,37
347,"The individual rights to speak up, the individual protection of the individual, individual property rights and all of those things is of paramount importance.",158
348,"And we build our organization, that's why democracy is from the bottom up or even a company.",92
349,We'll get together and we'll be partners to prosper together.,61
350,That is the American approach.,30
351,"He was describing that in China, it's an extension of the Confucian family essentially.",87
352,And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.,44
353,"And so what they think about is the common good, not the individualism.",71
354,"So for example, if they want a high speed rail to go from one place to another and that's best in the common good, then the individual protections that would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern.",219
355,So that notion of controlling.,30
356,"So for example, what they're doing with video games.",52
357,They control what type of video games and how many hours a day kids can be on video games operating in that way because they believe that that's good for the society and that's very controlling.,194
358,"In the United States, I think probably most parents would say, leave it to me.",78
359,And it's a matter between me and my kids.,41
360,The same thing has to do with data.,35
361,"In other words, in the United States, who controls the data?",60
362,Does the company control the data?,34
363,Do you individually control the data?,37
364,And so the inclination would be to figure that out.,51
365,But nobody would say that the government is going to control the data because of our inclination of really anti-government control.,131
366,"In China, it would be that the government will control the data because that's going to be best for the society.",112
367,And it depends who you trust.,29
368,"But that's so that difference in philosophy is very much at the, you know, at the heart of that.",96
369,"As far as your question in terms of effectiveness, it really is in China's case, it's how you balance the things, right?",120
370,"So what they're attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity in areas that are not political, let's say.",121
371,"And so you see on a lot of entrepreneurship, you see a lot of product development, you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.",133
372,"So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening is an old stereotype, but where's a lot of creativity certainly happening.",132
373,And the system can work well if they can achieve that kind of balance.,70
374,It's proven to have worked well.,32
375,"Since I started going there in 1984, per capita income, real per capita income is increased by 26 times.",104
376,The longevity rate is increased by 10 years.,44
377,"The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1% in terms of, you know, basics like starvation and things.",110
378,"And if you read history, Plato's Republic, you know, he talks about the cycles, democracy, you know, and watercratic and the benevolent death, the despot and all of that, each has their own vulnerability.",204
379,"The vulnerability of democracy, which has been a remarkable, remarkable system.",79
380,And I don't have to extol the benefits of it.,45
381,But the vulnerability of it has always been the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.,98
382,"In World War II, for democracies chose to be autocracies because there was internal disorder and there was the belief that somebody would bring about order and get control of this situation.",190
383,"You know, that was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.",54
384,They were parliamentary systems that turned themselves over to that.,68
385,So both systems have vulnerabilities.,37
386,I think the main thing that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities.,76
387,"Democracy is an amazing system because it, the adherence to the rules and the system and the checks and balances is quite amazing.",130
388,And it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.,59
389,But there has to be the respect of the rules.,45
390,"And when you see something like they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules, history is shown when the causes that people are behind are more important to them than the system.",193
391,The system is in jeopardy.,26
392,So we have a situation that's very much like that.,50
393,"In terms of, let's say the 2024 elections, I believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing, for example.",135
394,So we have that kind of a situation.,36
395,So one would hope that one could rise above the disagreements and rely on the system for resolving disagreements.,113
396,"Because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.",59
397,"So the kind of the trend that started in 2020, the, or I mean, I suppose it's been there, it's been growing.",108
398,One representation of this internal disorder has been the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election.,125
399,"Well, it started before that.",29
400,There was the emergence of population before President Trump was elected.,73
401,He was basically elected as a populist because there was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them.,141
402,And he tapped into that.,24
403,"And he was largely elected as a populist leader, first populist leader in a developed country.",94
404,And so populism began that then.,32
405,And that was a battle of one group against the other group.,59
406,"And so since then, it's been like that and it continued to grow.",64
407,"You mentioned the vulnerability of democracy, the internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.",102
408,What's the vulnerability of a system like China?,48
409,"Maybe one way to say it's put China aside and look at history, look at Soviet Union.",84
410,What's the vulnerability of a communist type system?,52
411,"Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic, depending on how much autocracy is that it lacks flexibility.",111
412,It lacks the ability.,21
413,But I should deal with them differently.,40
414,"In other words, there's the economic system.",44
415,The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.,58
416,So communism or socialism has to be done in a way where you can threaten productivity.,86
417,"Capitalism has, and when I mean by that, I mean free markets and capital markets, I've been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the incentives and the resources, providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.",244
418,"And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done through a large extent is to recognize that and have made a move.",118
419,That's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exists.,81
420,"But anyway, that's it as far as an autocratic system.",53
421,"Rather than one man, one vote from the population up, the risks of the autocratic system is that there's enough discontent that arises.",135
422,"That the system doesn't have the flexibility and that rather than bending, it breaks.",85
423,That's the big risk.,20
424,The notion of trying to control a population if there's that rather than giving it the flexibility.,99
425,So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.,55
426,What's the human?,17
427,Because you mentioned like the top gets bigger with the empires and you start taking things for granted.,104
428,Is some of this just human nature.,34
429,"So the concern with China, with autocratic nations, the concern with the third Reich, the Soviet Union, was that fundamentally at the individual level, the humans involved at the top.",183
430,"They started becoming, they're starting to lose touch with reality in a way that no longer makes them.",102
431,I guess that's the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to.,78
432,"Well, I mean in a democracy, you could change.",46
433,You can go as far left or as far right.,39
434,You can change the leaders easily.,34
435,"And so the people don't become, they pretty much only have themselves to blame.",79
436,One of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders.,68
437,But they have that flexibility.,31
438,"So if vote and you get what you wanted, in the case of the autocratic, let's say leaders, and then the movement from democracies to autocracies, what you see normally that movement is that one of the systems is not working.",223
439,Let's say the democracy is not effectively.,43
440,Everybody's arguing with each other.,36
441,Nobody's getting anything done.,31
442,"And you know, like Mussolini, the trains are not running on time.",65
443,And that would be the example.,30
444,"Jesus, this place has gotten chaotic.",37
445,"Well, somebody gets through control.",36
446,And then you get the autocratic.,32
447,And then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.,54
448,And then you follow those kinds of orders.,42
449,And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company going around and that could work well or it could work badly.,109
450,"You know, most companies are run as like autocracies in a sense.",64
451,"You know, there's the hierarchy and you the command economy and that kind of thing.",83
452,And that can work well or not.,30
453,"But then quite often when you get the populist autocratic, their personality is something that they want to fight.",114
454,And they become more nationalistic and they tend to become more militaristic.,77
455,"And human nature at that stage um, lends itself to fighting.",60
456,"There's an arc here that when we think it's we think of a country and we say we and we think of a country, um, it's not true.",125
457,It's not like that.,19
458,There are individuals who change.,33
459,One generation dies and another generation comes along.,55
460,"And one of those arcs is that um, the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily, you know, willing to abide by whatever the rules are.",168
461,"As you get farther along into that cycle and you get a new generation and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars, then they then they want to fight.",156
462,And so you're seeing right now the emergent of fight for right.,63
463,And what that means is you see it internally fight with where are you and fight for that thing and they mean fight.,115
464,And then externally fight.,26
465,Are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win?,58
466,And that develops on both sides this fight and win and they side is cheering each other on into a war.,102
467,But that's comes by those who really have not experienced war because it comes in their part of their lifetime.,111
468,Humans are fascinating.,23
469,Humans are fascinating.,23
470,"And by the way, human nature has not changed over the thousands of years.",73
471,"So it's so interesting because like in doing this study and it comes across in the study, it's like watching the same movie over and over again.",144
472,You see the arc and you see it happen over and over again.,58
473,The only things that seem to change are the close people wearing the technologies you think.,92
474,Yeah.,5
475,And then some of you probably will disagree with you about the clothes.,71
476,Maybe there's also cycles within fashion.,41
477,Maybe we're not even creative there.,36
478,What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?,46
479,What do you think about Putin as a leader as a human being on this world stage within the context of the cycles of the empires that you think about?,148
480,"Well, Putin came to power at the failure of Russia's last order.",64
481,So there was there was the end of communism.,44
482,"And there was the development of the market economy, the collapse of the Soviet Union.",86
483,"And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin who was an alcoholic and had problems managing and was put into power.",116
484,And the conditions in the Russian were the work.,48
485,There was anarchy.,18
486,There was no money.,19
487,It was it had the classic end of cycle ingredients.,51
488,It was broke.,13
489,It was three people were fighting with each other.,50
490,It was in the anarchy.,22
491,And that's when he came to power.,33
492,And there were not institutions.,32
493,The whole thing had collapsed.,30
494,"There was not effective ministry of education, ministry of anything.",68
495,And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability and they needed a democracy.,87
496,And they needed the improvement of capital markets.,51
497,"So he's been in that position as a I guess I would call him a semi-autocratic leader in that from all indications, he would respect the democracy.",146
498,And he's very popular.,22
499,He's one democratic elections because he's been a strong leader and he's brought peace and stability to the Soviet to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.,163
500,And he's a strong leader in pursuit of the countries interests in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power.,121
501,But it is a significant military power.,39
502,So the issues and then there's a strong alliance between Russia and China now.,78
503,So that's kind of the lay of the land.,38
504,And then there are sensitivities.,33
505,The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity because there are a lot of Russians who live in the Ukraine.,95
506,And there's also the issue of NATO on their border.,51
507,So there are those kinds of things.,35
508,And he has military power.,26
509,And he has a strong alliance with China.,40
510,And I guess that's my best summary of what his position is.,59
511,"Strong leader, popular.",23
512,These are not subjective interpretations.,41
513,These are objective interpretations.,36
514,"Yeah, it's interesting just in this conversation.",49
515,You're not sort of doing the usual criticism of any one particular system.,74
516,You're looking at these systems from the perspective of history.,64
517,You're just describing how they work.,37
518,"It's often times when you talk about what Russia is today or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today is you start to criticize while they do this kind of censorship or they do this kind of, they limit freedoms in this kind of way.",239
519,"But you're just kind of describing this as a nation with ideas, what they think is right.",89
520,This is how they hope to get it to work.,40
521,This is why it's working.,25
522,This is what's not working.,27
523,Here's metrics that show that it's not working.,47
524,I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.,50
525,It's easy though.,17
526,"I mean, you got some criticism saying that I think China is a strict parent.",76
527,Some people criticize these countries for doing so for violating human rights.,78
528,I suppose there are some people that criticize the United States for violating human rights.,92
529,"But what are your thoughts on the world stage today about some of the behaviors in this government in terms of respecting the rights, the basic rights of human beings?",167
530,You described accurately how I just tried to look at things in a non.,69
531,I don't want to impute my values on anybody.,44
532,"I mean, there are intolerable things.",37
533,So I'm not saying there aren't ill intolerable things.,54
534,But one of the great things of being an American here is that I grew up with all different nationalities having all different points of view and all different religions and all different ways of operating.,205
535,And I've come to treasure the fact that that is what's their business is their business.,88
536,And then the question is where do you cross the line under what circumstances that others have got to do it my way?,115
537,"And then when you do it internationally, the issue of what is a sovereign state, which as I say in the piece of Westphalia and you have borders and then when do you cross the line that my way of doing things has got to be their way of doing things or what are the various rights?",279
538,And so that's a very delicate question or a very difficult question.,68
539,And we all have responsibilities to different parties and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things.,130
540,"So for example, as an international investor, I have a responsibility to my investors.",86
541,Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that?,80
542,"So if you're taking Nike or stinkers and so on and Americans can decide whether they want to buy a Chinese products or not by Chinese products, we are all faced with those types of choices.",189
543,"So you have what do you want to do in your constituency and you have your choices and then beyond that, in many cases, the issues are quite complex like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.",205
544,"So and then I believe that if you disconnect it, if all those if entities like myself, the businesses doing business with China disconnected, I think that that would be disastrous, economically disastrous, and it would also be reduce the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.",311
545,And so these are all complicated.,33
546,So what we do is and who makes it my opinion matters the most.,62
547,Why should it be my opinion that matters the most in making that decision?,74
548,"So I largely look at the government guidance that I get not only for my own government, but from the other governments and I follow the rules.",142
549,"I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries and we want to do that in the best way to provide the diversified portfolio and we sort of need that up.",141
550,Every one of those countries has similar complexities.,54
551,There are always one issue or another and there's only so much that we really understand about all of those issues.,115
552,So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.,47
553,"Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect to the culture of the place, the way things are done.",98
554,"You don't necessarily the way you heal relationships between nations, like you said, you work together and that requires kind of to listen maybe more than you talk.",164
555,And I think people in the public sphere talk a lot about China without really listening without understanding much about China without one of the things that makes me really sad because I know how to speak Russian and I can I know how much is lost in translation.,263
556,"It makes me sad that I'll never really get to know the Chinese culture because like I'll never really get to know the language, the literature, the just talk to regular people.",176
557,"It's not just the government or officials or scientists, just regular folks and get the culture.",96
558,"I think if you don't understand the culture, just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country, about their family, what the kind of hopes they have, what kind of values they have without that, you're not going to be able to fully connect with them.",275
559,And you have to do that first to have a chance of building a good world.,72
560,I couldn't agree with you more.,31
561,"I was very lucky because as I say, you know, since 1984, so for more than half of my life, I've been going there and I and the common people and all sorts of people and I've got to meet them.",191
562,"I don't speak the language, but a combination of through translators or them speaking English and being in situations I had my son go to school, a local school and we developed those kinds of understandings.",207
563,I think that but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most scary.,94
564,Yeah.,5
565,Like I'm right now in the middle and and all I want to try to do is to help mutual understanding.,97
566,You're right.,13
567,"If there were questions probing me asking me, what is it?",57
568,I'm not on one side or another.,31
569,I get I don't want to be on one side or another.,48
570,I believe that each has their right within there to approach their different culture in their own way.,102
571,So many ways you gave an example.,33
572,"If they're not doing harm to others, I mean, so but that issue of trying to understand is so much better.",105
573,That doesn't mean agree with.,29
574,"If you are wanting to out clever and out compete somebody, it still pays to understand what they're thinking.",109
575,"So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking, even if you want to go to war with them, that understanding is the best thing to have.",140
576,What we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality and that means that anything that serves the seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the notion of I'm on their side in a war and that's kind of a dangerous thing because there's a momentum here to fight.,317
577,Henry Kissinger praises you new book and you thank him in it in the dedication.,79
578,What's your relationship like with him?,39
579,What makes him interesting?,27
580,Maybe what makes him controversial?,35
581,What makes him such a central figure in history?,48
582,"First, most importantly, he's unique about seeing things through all the others' eyes.",86
583,"If you were, it's like there's a chess game.",44
584,"I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game, but with multiple chess players playing the same game.",104
585,So imagine there are six people around playing the chess game and he could sit in each seat and he could know how they see it.,126
586,And see it in a calm way of how they see it.,44
587,He's unique in that way.,24
588,He's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that.,51
589,And he has a background that in which he's a historian.,55
590,So he really understands history super terrifically.,52
591,He doesn't understand economic history as much.,47
592,So that's why to something that we enjoy having conversation because he's interested in the economic piece.,107
593,He doesn't know and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that I don't know as well.,90
594,"But anyway, he's able to do that, but not only a historian, but a practitioner.",79
595,"So when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has that talent to see things through other's eyes in an objective way and to be strategic rather than just tactical, that's a very special person and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person.",255
596,"Yeah, he's lived a fascinating life.",36
597,"Just all of the world events he's been involved in, is fascinating.",67
598,"And like you said, that's such an interesting skill to have.",60
599,"To consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams, the fears of all the people at the table?",98
600,What are they thinking?,23
601,"I find that people don't, once again, don't do that enough when it's the obvious thing you should be doing, whether it's business deals or political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation.",189
602,"I'm often surprised again, so I had to go to the Russian thing because I hear I hear Putin talk in Russian and you start to infer certain intentions and not the trivial stuff.",175
603,"Like the human being, what is that human being hoping for himself, for his country, for his close in the circle, for the bigger?",128
604,And I just see that that's often just loss in translation.,58
605,"I just see like American leaders talking to Putin and it's just not, there's not a connection.",94
606,Absolutely.,11
607,I know exactly what you're talking about.,41
608,"It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation or even reading a speech and you see then it reported the inevitably, the reporter picked some headline characterization that has very little to do with what was really happening, but might be a headline grabber that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding of really what's going on.",367
609,"If it's okay, let me ask you a couple questions about cryptocurrency.",69
610,You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.,55
611,What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today?,43
612,It's role in the global financial system and just in human society in general.,78
613,"Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has influenced changes in my view.",106
614,"It has proven itself something like 10, 11 years ago.",53
615,Imagine the programming of this and here's you throw it out and that's the idea.,80
616,It has not been hacked.,23
617,"It has operated, it has built, it has come an amazing way over that 11 years to be maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people and has been used and is now has obtained the status of having imputed value.",220
618,"At the same time, it is one of those assets that is an alternative money.",73
619,I think we're entering an era where there's going to be a competition of monies because of the printing of fiat money and the depreciated value.,144
620,"There will be a competition of monies and Bitcoin is part of that competition but there will be many monies, not just crypto monies but there will be central bank crypto monies but there will be different kinds of monies.",221
621,"Even monies are things that you buy and sell NFTs can become a money, a type of money.",86
622,You own it and it's an investment and you could say I'd rather own it than own Bitcoin.,87
623,It has a radalya body and NFTs.,31
624,Not yet.,8
625,Only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs to just experience them.,72
626,I think I should produce one and I should have asked that.,58
627,Have you minted an NFT?,23
628,You probably should just to know what it's like.,48
629,That's right.,13
630,This stuff is happening.,24
631,This stuff is real and how it operates.,39
632,All new real things.,20
633,"Some are going to go and the internet in the year 2000, pets.com could have been a great, but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows.",139
634,That's the beauty of the competitive system that will evolve and some things will be treasured and some things will be trashed.,127
635,"When I look at it, I think we are in an environment of what is an alternative money.",84
636,"A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth.",73
637,We are looking for and it's portable and it's best if it's recognized in other countries.,89
638,Gold is one of those.,21
639,"I look at it as an alternative gold, but I look at a number of things as an alternative gold.",93
640,I think that gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities.,68
641,"For example, you can't trace it.",32
642,"In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it where it's going and so on.",65
643,Governments can have that ability to trace it and so a gold piece of coin.,74
644,It's not connected.,19
645,"I think not connected has benefits, particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more risky.",102
646,Gold has been for many thousands of years universally recognized as a source of money.,86
647,"Central banks, it's the third largest source of money in central bank reserves.",79
648,I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes and so on.,74
649,"For various reasons, I prefer gold to the other.",48
650,But it's a little bit part of my mix.,37
651,"You look at it, I think, 69,000 this year is the high Bitcoin hit.",66
652,Do you think it's possible?,27
653,You mentioned gold.,19
654,"Do you think it's possible to reach as very high numbers, like 1 million that some people talk about?",101
655,I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it is there's a certain amount of a certain amount of it.,113
656,There's a certain amount of gold.,33
657,I'll use gold as a benchmark.,29
658,The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion total crypto is about 2.2 trillion.,79
659,But let's say Bitcoin.,22
660,It's $1 trillion.,17
661,"If you take the amount of money that is in gold that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks and I assume Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes, that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.",239
662,"So right now, if you were to have a portfolio that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin, it's worth about 20% of the value of gold.",132
663,Do I think it's going to be worth more than gold?,49
664,"In terms of that mix, I don't think it'll be worth more than gold.",66
665,But let's say it became worth as much as gold.,46
666,I don't believe it will be.,27
667,I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.,44
668,I really don't know what the right answer is.,45
669,Then there's the question of what is all of that pool of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything else?,132
670,"Does it go from, let's call it $678 trillion to $16 trillion?",61
671,Maybe it could double.,22
672,It depends what it is in the world environment.,47
673,"But basically, if you use gold as a measure, it just makes no sense that it's going to be used that much more.",110
674,Am I sure about that?,21
675,I'm not sure about anything.,28
676,"But logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation on its price in relationship to other things that are like it.",118
677,Let me ask for your deep financial analysis and a very important issue.,71
678,"I just talked a couple days ago, Elon Musk.",43
679,He wants to put a literal dogecoin on the moon.,47
680,What are your thoughts about dogecoin?,38
681,Do you think it'll be the official currency?,44
682,Maybe reserve currency on the moon and on Mars.,47
683,My reaction is that's cute.,27
684,I remember Elon when he first got his money from PayPal.,56
685,"I think he said to me, he got $180 million, $90 million, he decided to say, why aren't we going to outer space?",111
686,"He wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified using Russian technology to put a plant and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it was.",151
687,"He said, first life on Mars or first life on that as an inspiring notion.",73
688,Then there's always what's behind it.,37
689,I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability to do other things behind it.,72
690,I would take that as symbolic and I'd be asking him what's behind it.,69
691,What's next?,12
692,I'm also just on the topic of dogecoin and meme coin.,53
693,"There's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness that's really interesting about that we would communicate what ideas become viral, how to captivate people with ideas.",168
694,There's something about taking things too seriously that somehow slows it all down and it's interesting.,104
695,You're right.,13
696,That's part of human nature somehow.,36
697,Humor is part of this whole thing.,34
698,You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down and you have principles in particular.,95
699,Principles.,11
700,"You have this really nice thing in your book where you actually, I think there's such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important and you make them bold.",173
701,That's a brilliant idea.,24
702,Let me just ask the high level question of what's a good system for taking notes?,81
703,"Well, I find that almost everything happens over and over again.",64
704,We're in the blizzard of these things happening.,48
705,"What I found is that if I'm making a decision that after I make the decision usually or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down, in other words, principle is a recipe.",199
706,How would I make that decision?,31
707,What are the criteria around it?,32
708,I find that I make it much more clear.,38
709,It becomes clear and it applies to the next thing that comes along.,67
710,It'll be that way because everything happens over and over and over again.,74
711,"I think people make the mistake of looking at just the one, like it's the first one.",84
712,I don't know.,13
713,They have the first problem of this sort of the first child or whatever it is.,78
714,This has been happening plenty of time.,39
715,"If you have the principles, I found that helped me think more clearly about it and it helped me communicate better, like why?",125
716,"Over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done.",68
717,I did it originally to communicate very well with people I work with.,69
718,I set up my company and it was very important to have good communication.,73
719,Then we could debate the principles.,36
720,That's the process.,19
721,I urge people to do that.,25
722,There are many excellent decision makers.,41
723,"I just wish that they wrote down their principles when this set, for example, we talk about Henry Kissinger and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership.",172
724,Don't just describe the leaders.,32
725,Describe then what about them were the essential elements to make a good leader under what circumstances.,105
726,"If we think about that, then you begin to think in a principled way.",68
727,"Then when you start to think in a principled way, life becomes so much easier to make decisions and it's so much less confusing because it's like coming up on a species and you say, okay, well, what species is it?",213
728,It's a thing.,13
729,What species is it?,19
730,How do I deal with that species effectively?,44
731,That's what that is.,20
732,I encourage people to write it down.,36
733,I wish anybody who's successful wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those types of decisions.,113
734,So the events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways as you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process that's right to respond to those patterns and you call that the principles and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.,276
735,So like that codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future.,83
736,What advice do you have for young folks today?,46
737,"In high school, in college, thinking about how to live, have a career that can be proud of or maybe have a life that can be proud of?",133
738,"Know yourself, follow your passion, make your work and passion the same thing while considering the money part because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to beg that.",181
739,"But if you know yourself, feel the pull and pursue that passion.",64
740,"Along those lines, by the way, I found that using personality profile tests has been very helpful.",98
741,I've used those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other.,105
742,So I created a free one that is called Principles You.,54
743,It's online.,12
744,"It's had remarkable loving people who've taken it, learned about themselves, but also you can put in somebody else and it'll tell you about your relationship with them.",168
745,"That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery, but the main thing is to understand on your journey, your hero's journey when you're that you will have mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those, not fight those because by understanding mistakes, you will learn not to make mistakes again.",305
746,I have a principle which is pain plus reflection equals progress.,65
747,"So that reflection is important to know yourself, know your pulls, know your weaknesses.",88
748,"And when you also know your weaknesses and the strengths of other people, there are people who have strengths where you're weak and you have strengths where they're weak and to be able to work well together is the most effective way of achieving success.",254
749,"So yeah, it's that journey and there's a life arc and there's a journey and you want to make it the best that you can make it and it has, it's like a video game, you know, it has the challenges and the obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations and all of that and the maximizing learning to go where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important.",383
750,"That's kind of maybe a long-winded way of seeing it, but to learn, I think I'll try to say it simply, there's a five-step process.",130
751,Step one is know your goals.,28
752,Know what you're going after.,29
753,"You could have almost anything you want, but you can't have everything you want and so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction.",141
754,"On the way to your goals, you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.",85
755,"So identifying, step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles, identify them.",90
756,"Step three is to diagnose them to get at the root cause of the problem and that could be many root causes, but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others, but you have to be objective about them.",209
757,"Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four, which is to design a way to get around them and then after you have that design, you implement that design so you have to follow through and do it and you do that and that will then produce its new results, which should be better results.",288
758,I call this kind of a looping process.,38
759,It's the evolutionary looping process and you just keep doing that and you learn over a period of time and you move in the direction that you want.,147
760,Last question and you only have one minute to answer it.,56
761,"You dedicate the book, quote, to my grandchildren and those of their generation who will be participants in the continuation of the story.",138
762,May the force of evolution be with you.,39
763,"So let me ask, where is this force of evolution taking human civilization and what in this story that evolution is writing gives you hope?",138
764,Evolution is in a direction toward improvement and the greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent.,108
765,"So you see in the charts in the book, you see that this upward movement, life expectancy, health, all the things that we think are better.",138
766,You see there's a chart and it shows that over a period of time and you barely see the downturns from depressions and wars in that.,131
767,That is the greatest power.,27
768,Man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution and that's the greatest power and that is what gives me justifiable hope.,120
769,"And a continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon, maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species.",102
770,"So not only will we keep creating amazing things here on Earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos.",105
771,"My time horizon isn't going to have me analyzing that yet, but I hope so when I agree that that would be in the next one.",121
772,So I'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on Mars.,66
773,I think we'll focus on Earth for now.,37
774,"Thank you so much for your brilliance, for the books you've written, for the works you've done, for the inspiration, for millions.",130
775,So and thank you for spending your valuable time here with me today.,68
776,Thank you.,10
777,Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.,57
778,"To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.",74
779,And now let me leave you with some words from Ray Dalio himself.,64
780,"Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.",100
781,You have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.,99
782,Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.,54
