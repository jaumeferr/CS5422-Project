0," And okay, that'll just be a very professional.",47
1,"Well, you know, people are like, how do you live and things like that?",70
2,They're taking money from the Russians and of course the answer is no.,70
3,But I do this for a living like I speak.,40
4,"I don't have a YouTube channel where it's, you know, I'm Joe Rogan.",67
5,But I give speeches at universities and things like that.,57
6,"I do a lot of interviews and so we're recording now, right?",59
7,Right on set up.,16
8,Is it possible that you could do a YouTube channel?,51
9,Would that work?,16
10,"I mean, if, yeah, like I mean, if you introduce me so like I get followers, yeah, we could do that.",99
11,"Dude, I'm all in.",17
12,That could absolutely happen.,29
13,Do you want to do that?,23
14,Is that something you want to do?,33
15,"Well, I mean, this is a big question.",37
16,"So I came on because I had just written a book called Permanent Record, which is the story of my life because that's what publishers make you do when you're writing your first book.",181
17,But it's more than that because I didn't just want to talk about me.,68
18,"It's actually about the changing of technology and the changing of government in this sort of post-9-11 era, which you know, our generation just sort of happened to be growing up during.",186
19,And I was at the CIA and the NSA and all this stuff.,52
20,"But the day that the book came out, the government hit me with a lawsuit.",73
21,And they hit the publisher of the books with a lawsuit because they don't want to see books like this get written.,114
22,They especially don't want to see books like this get read.,59
23,"And so the big thing was, you know, we didn't know where this was going.",72
24,We didn't know what was going to happen.,40
25,And my publisher of course wanted me very badly to let people know this book existed in case the government leaned hard and hard and hard.,138
26,And we didn't know where that's going.,38
27,The government is still pursuing that case quite strongly.,58
28,"They're more focused on the financial censorship side of it, basically taking any money that I made from it kind of as a warning to the others.",143
29,"And getting a legal judgment against the publishers saying, you know, you can't pay the sky that kind of thing.",111
30,"More so than taking the book off the shelves, but that's not because they're okay with the book being on the shelves.",117
31,It's because thankfully we've got the first amendment and so they can't.,72
32,And that's a very rare and good thing.,38
33,"But anyway, in the context of that, they were like, well, what about Joe Rogan?",79
34,"And you know, I had heard about you at this point, but you know, the only thing that I had really seen that I really understood had familiarity with was like you talking to Bernie Sanders, which by the way, I very much appreciated hearing that because a lot of people don't give the guy time to talk to hear him in those sound bites.",333
35,You don't really get an understanding of who he actually is.,60
36,Right.,6
37,And this is the other thing.,28
38,"Like they're like, well, you know, you can go on all these major network shows.",79
39,And I did a couple of them.,27
40,I did like a morning show.,26
41,I did Brian Williams.,21
42,"But broadly, the media, the sort of more corporatized media, as we might say, is exactly what you just described, right?",120
43,"They want you to be able to answer in light eight, 15 seconds or less.",70
44,"And when we're talking about big massive shifts in society, when we're talking about power, we're talking about technology and how it controls and influences us in the future, you can't have a meaningful conversation within those constraints.",242
45,"And so instead, these guys all want to say, repeat these long discredited sort of criticism.",92
46,"You know, I'm sure you'll ask the same thing.",45
47,And that's okay.,16
48,"There are questions, but it's like, we can't have the conversation if we can't have this space to think and breathe and have this sort of discussion.",149
49,"So anyway, they mentioned you.",30
50,"And I was like, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.",48
51,Where do I know this name from before Bernie Sanders?,53
52,And I look back through my Twitter mentions.,44
53,"And the funny thing is, your fans have been harassing me to death for like the last years.",90
54,"Wonderful people, wonderful people.",35
55,"But like, go on, Joe Rogan, go on, Joe Rogan.",45
56,"And I remember like after I had just made a Twitter account, Neil deGrasse Tyson actually, I helped me get on Twitter, gave me that little initial boost.",153
57,"And they said, Joe Rogan.",25
58,"And so I, they like linked you and you know, I mouse over your name because I use a desktop and not mobile for this because security reasons.",141
59,"And it pops up and I get your avatar, man.",42
60,"Like I have to say, your logo is the worst thing in the world for people who are like trying to be like politically serious.",124
61,"And you know, they're worried about the national security advisor condemning it because like this bald guy with this maniacal grin and like the third eye on his forehead.",170
62,"And I'm like, oh, man, that's show.",35
63,"You know, that doesn't look good.",33
64,"But it's actually like when you watch, you know, when you watch what you do, it's great stuff, man.",99
65,It's great.,11
66,But that first impression like I.,33
67,This almost didn't happen.,26
68,"But everybody who has talked to you, you know, everybody who watches you show, I think they get a very different impression than how you're paying it.",150
69,"And for me, it's a wonderful thing because nobody understands that better than I do, right?",91
70,Like the government ran a smear campaign against me endlessly for six months.,77
71,"When I came forward in June of 2013, I know we got way off topic here.",70
72,I'll get back to it.,20
73,Fine.,5
74,There's no such thing as off topic.,35
75,We could do it.,15
76,We can talk about whatever.,27
77,Great.,6
78,Great.,6
79,"So for those people, first of all, who have no idea who the hell I am, I'm the guy who is behind the revelations of global mass surveillance in 2013.",149
80,I worked for the CIA.,21
81,I worked for the NSA as a contractor.,37
82,"The NSA staff officer, the CIA, I was undercover working at an embassies.",73
83,But and I talk about the difference between this and a book and contractor and government official and how it's all sort of lost its meaning.,141
84,But I saw something wrong.,26
85,And I saw basically the government was violating the law.,57
86,"And what I believed to be the Constitution of the United States and more broadly human rights for everyone in the United States and around the world, there were domestic surveillance programs, there were mass surveillance programs that worked internationally.",259
87,"Basically, everything that they could monitor, they were monitoring.",68
88,And this is actually like people who isn't that obvious isn't that what they're supposed to do.,95
89,"And this is weird, but the answer actually is no.",49
90,What are the framework of our Constitution?,43
91,"The government is only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an individualized, particularized suspicion of wrongdoing for.",130
92,"This is we think about this in the investigative means, right?",62
93,Like all those TV shows where they're like go and get a warrant.,64
94,"The reason they have to do that, like we fought a revolution over this a couple hundred years back, is the idea that when we had kings, when we had governments of absolute power, they could simply go in your home and go, you know, is this guy pot smoker, get his diary, you know, whatever it is.",295
95,"And just like if you find evidence of crime, you march them off to prison and it's all good.",92
96,"You found evidence, they're criminal, where you didn't find evidence, well, no harm, no foul, you're just doing what government does.",133
97,"We were trying to build a better system where it went, yes, the government has extraordinary capabilities, but it only uses them where they're necessary, right?",160
98,"They're there, proportionate to the threat that is presented by this person.",76
99,"You know, like we shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got like a baggy of weed in their dresser or something like that.",123
100,That is not a threat to national security.,42
101,That is not a threat to public safety.,38
102,But what happened in the wake of 9-11 was a whole bunch of government officials got to gather behind closed doors.,114
103,And this was actually led interestingly enough by the vice president of the United States Cheney.,97
104,"Can look that name up, Dick Cheney, and his personal attorney, sort of the Giuliani of Dick Cheney, a guy named David Addington.",128
105,And this lawyer David Addington wrote a secret legal interpretation that no one else was allowed to see.,104
106,It was kept in the vice president's safe at the White House.,60
107,"They weren't giving this even when they told people, and it was just a couple people in Congress, Nancy Pelosi was one of them and a couple of these other folks, when they talked to the heads of the agency, the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this stuff.",258
108,"They told them the White House and the Office of Legal Counsel and you know, this, this, the president's attorneys, all of these guys had decided this would be legal to do.",172
109,But we can't tell you why.,26
110,"We can't show you the legal authorization, or you just got to take our word for it.",83
111,"And so they did this and this became a master violence program called Stellar Wind, which they said was supposed to monitor the phone calls and internet communications, emails and things like that of everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access to for links to Al Qaeda.",303
112,"Because if you remember in the wake of the September 11th attacks, they were saying we thought there could be sleeper cells of Al Qaeda.",136
113,"There was just, you know, peppered all throughout the country and they were going to spring up at any moment.",109
114,"Of course, it's like weapons of mass destruction.",49
115,It just didn't exist.,21
116,It was all a power grab.,24
117,"But on that basis, they started doing this in secret and it was completely unconstitutional.",92
118,"It was completely illegal, even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot Act.",85
119,But they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it.,62
120,And they thought this is a really powerful capability.,54
121,What did we start using this first stuff that was other than terrorism?,71
122,Because it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terrorists in this context that they were looking for them.,126
123,And the ones who were there were terrorists.,44
124,The program wasn't affected because these were guys in Pakistan that weren't using email and phone calls.,105
125,They were getting on a moped with their cousin who was a courier who was bringing a letter to his guy who runs the food stand or whatever.,138
126,"But bit by bit, over time, this grew and grew and grew and there were scandals.",79
127,"And if you want to drill down on these later, I'll go into them.",64
128,But what happened was step by step by step.,43
129,Our constitutional rights were changed.,39
130,And we weren't allowed to know it.,34
131,We were never granted a vote on it.,35
132,"And even the many members of Congress, right?",45
133,535 in the United States.,25
134,They were prohibited from knowing this.,39
135,"And instead they told only a few select people, in the original case, there were only eight members of Congress called the Gang of Eight who knew about this.",157
136,"Then there were the people on the intelligence committees, both in the Senate and the House who were told about this.",117
137,But they were only told partially about it.,43
138,They weren't told the full scope of it.,39
139,"And now that they have been told about it because they had security clearances and things like that, they weren't allowed telling anybody else.",143
140,Even if they objected to it.,28
141,"And we had one senator, Ron Wyden, and another one I believe Tom Yudall was the name of him, who did object to this and who wanted something to happen.",151
142,"But because they couldn't tell anybody that was having, they were sort of doing these weird lassie barks to the press where they were like, we have grave concerns about the way these programs are being carried out.",214
143,But nobody knew what they were talking about.,45
144,"And so journalists were like, you know, they've got concerns.",61
145,What is that lassie?,20
146,What are you trying to say?,27
147,Tenies and Well?,16
148,But they were getting it wrong.,31
149,They couldn't tell what was happening.,38
150,"So what had happened was that we, the American people, had sort of lost our seat at the table of government.",108
151,We were no longer partnered to government.,42
152,We had simply become subject to government.,43
153,"And I think everybody who's in the world today, who is aware of what's going on, whether it's under this administration, the last administration, the one before that, right?",173
154,"They have seen a constant kind of shift where we have, we the public have less say and less influence over the policy of government with each passing year.",155
155,"There's kind of a new class that's being created, a government class and then the public civil class that are held to different standards of behavior.",150
156,"And when we start talking about leaking and whistle blowing, this becomes even more clear.",90
157,"And so what I did was I wanted to clarify that kind of lassie bark, right?",74
158,I just wanted everybody to know what was going on.,50
159,I didn't want to say the government can't do this.,50
160,I didn't want to say this is how you guys have to live because that's not for me to say.,88
161,"But I do believe that everybody in the United States and more broadly, people in the world who are having the rights violated by a government should have at least an understanding of how that is happening, what the authorities, sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that are so that they can protest them so that they can cast a vote about them so that they can't say, you know what?",397
162,"You guys say this is okay, but I disagree.",42
163,This is not okay.,17
164,I object and I want things to change.,37
165,And so I gathered evidence of what I believe to be criminal or unconstitutional activity in the part of the government.,119
166,"And I gave this to journalists, right?",38
167,"Now I gave this to journalists under a very strict condition here, which was that they publish no story in this archive of information simply because it was interesting, right?",176
168,"No clickbait, not anything just because they thought it would make news, it would get them awards.",98
169,They would only publish stories that they were willing to make an institutional judgment and stand behind.,106
170,And this was three different newspapers that it was in the public interest to know.,83
171,"And so then beyond that, there was additional, because if you could see sort of what I was doing here, what had happened, what had led us into this pitfall was that, um, the system of checks and balances that supposed to self-regulate our government had failed.",261
172,The courts had abdicated their role in policing the executive in the Congress because terrorism was such a hot argument at the time.,132
173,"They were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong and attacked it, go through.",104
174,And they didn't have access to the information that the programs were ineffective.,82
175,So they were just taking the government's word for it.,54
176,And they didn't want to wait.,29
177,"And most of them didn't even know, right?",41
178,And the ones who did know it was the same thing.,48
179,They were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that were getting rich for building these systems that were violating the rights of each of us.,173
180,So they benefited by just saying nothing.,41
181,"And then the executive themselves, whether we're talking about Bush, right, whether we're talking about Obama or whether we're talking about Trump now, all these guys were okay with a constantly growing surveillance state because they're the ones whose hands were on the lever at the time.",289
182,They got to aim it.,19
183,They got to use it.,19
184,"If you had a little search box in front of you, they would give you the email history and everybody in the United States.",121
185,"Anybody you want, if you could pull up their text messages, anybody you want, if you could see anything they ever typed into that Google search box, right?",155
186,"Joe, what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box?",68
187,"That lasts forever, right?",26
188,And they have a record of that.,31
189,They can get that from Google.,30
190,And so this was this was the whole thing.,41
191,How do we correct for that?,27
192,"So when you have somebody who wants to inform the public of something, and we'll get into the proper channels arguments later, but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong and is doing it anyway, right?",262
193,That's the whole origin of the program is they want to do something that they're not allowed to do.,99
194,What do you do?,15
195,Right?,6
196,I'm the president of secrets.,29
197,"I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet and I could have them the technologists, right?",100
198,"I worked with the journalists and then to create an adversarial step, right?",76
199,"Someone who would argue against what I believed and hopefully with the journalists believe once they consulted the documents and basically authenticated them, can we get the government to play that role, right?",210
200,"And so before the journalists published any story, this is a controversial thing.",81
201,"People still criticize me for this, actually, they say I was too accommodated in government.",92
202,They could be right.,20
203,Is that the journalists would go to the government and give them warning.,73
204,"Say, we're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X, Y, and Z bad thing.",101
205,"One, is that right?",19
206,"And the government always go, oh, no comment, right?",52
207,"Two, is this going to cause harm?",33
208,Is anybody going to get hurt?,29
209,Is this program effective?,26
210,"Is there something we don't understand, right?",46
211,Is there something snowed and doesn't understand?,49
212,Is this guy just not get it?,28
213,Right?,6
214,Are these documents fake?,25
215,Whatever you want.,18
216,Say we shouldn't run this story.,32
217,"And in every case, I'm aware of that process was followed.",58
218,"And that's why, right?",22
219,"Because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me, who criticize me, who go this person's safe, this cost, harm to people or whatever.",144
220,We're in 2019 now.,18
221,"I came forward and these stories won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service Journalism, starting way back in June of 2013.",121
222,We've had six years to show bodies.,35
223,We've had six years to show harm.,33
224,"And you know, as well as I do, the government's happy to leak things when it's in their interest.",97
225,Nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because everyone who was involved in them was so careful.,111
226,We wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks.,78
227,And I think we did a pretty good job of it.,43
228,"But just to get back to the main thing, the original thing that got us off on that trail, when I came forward in June of 2013, I gave one interview to the people who were in the room with the documents, Laura Poitrus, Glenn Greenwald, you and McCaskel.",252
229,And I said who I was.,21
230,I said why I was doing this.,28
231,I said what this was about why it matters.,42
232,And that we were constructing a system of turnkey tyranny.,58
233,"And even if you trust that to Obama, you never know whose hand is going to be on that key next.",95
234,And all they have to do is turn it.,35
235,And there's nothing we can do to stop it.,41
236,"The only thing that's restraining these programs really is policy, more so than law.",84
237,And the president at any time can sign a napkin and those policies change.,74
238,"Well after that, I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people to talk about me.",111
239,I wanted them to talk about what actually mattered.,51
240,And the government of course was trying very hard to change the conversation as they always do to be about who is this guy.,123
241,What have they done?,20
242,What's wrong with them?,23
243,What are their problems?,24
244,Who is this loony guy?,22
245,So they can controversialize the source of a story rather than having to confront the story itself.,99
246,And that's why I said I really kind of appreciate.,50
247,"You're take on the media and everything like that because when you don't tell your story, other people will tell it for you.",124
248,They'll say so many things about you and they'll have these misunderstandings like I did because of something stupid as the avatar that you were using on Twitter.,162
249,Where I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy and it's this crazy stuff.,95
250,"But when I actually listened to you, when I actually look at the facts, right?",78
251,"And when I hear you just speak, I go, actually this is a thoughtful guy.",72
252,"Actually this is somebody who does care, who does want to look at these things deeply and appearances and our first impressions can be very misleading.",151
253,I work hard on that.,20
254,I try to mislead people.,24
255,It's good.,10
256,Works to my advantage.,22
257,"You're doing a good job, man.",29
258,Thank you.,10
259,I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA.,63
260,"You started as a contractor, right?",35
261,What was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrely with the programs they run?,116
262,So I'm not saying this to put you on the spot.,46
263,I know you've been a busy guy.,30
264,I know you haven't done.,24
265,I think shows recently.,23
266,"You come back from break, right?",32
267,But have you read the book because it'll just help me put your book.,68
268,"If you haven't got a chance to read it, you can go.",51
269,"No, I have not read your book.",30
270,We've got a copy of it.,23
271,"OK, well I will send you a signed copy, brother.",48
272,Beautiful.,10
273,Thank you.,10
274,I hope you read it and I hope you enjoy it.,43
275,But all right.,14
276,So I had a really weird history in the intelligence community.,62
277,I grew up in a federal family.,30
278,"In the shadow for me, right?",28
279,All these little suburban communities in Maryland where basically the entire industry of the state is the federal government of all these different agencies.,157
280,"And then all the subcontractors, all the defense industries that serve that government really are kind of our war making machine, our system of control, forward the country and the world broadly.",195
281,All that stuff spreads and you know a couple hundred mile rays out of DC.,73
282,"My mother worked for the district courts, rather than the federal courts.",73
283,And it's kind of funny because she still works there.,53
284,And those are the courts that are trying to throw me a jail for the rest of my life now.,88
285,"My father worked for the Coast Guard, retired after 30 years.",61
286,My grandfather was an admiral and then he worked for the FBI.,61
287,"As far back as it goes, my family, my whole line of family, even generations back, was working for the government.",114
288,"So it was pretty ordinary, pretty expected for me to go into the same kind of work.",83
289,"I started, and I wasn't super successful in school because I felt, and you know this is the most arrogant thing in the world than anybody says, that I had more to learn from computers than I did from biology class.",214
290,And so I spent more and more time focusing on technology than I got mono and I dropped about high school.,105
291,"And now it's like, all right, how do I make this up?",52
292,"I say drop out of high school, but I'm actually going to community college, right?",82
293,They called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high school.,85
294,I'm going to community college instead.,39
295,And I'm not doing that great there either.,42
296,"Like it's fine, you know I'm enjoying it, but you know school is school.",72
297,"I want, I can't wait to be grown.",33
298,You're bored.,13
299,"And I think a lot of people have felt that, but I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home based business doing web design.",148
300,"And they could see I was kind of technical and they went, hey, do you want to work for me?",90
301,"And I was like, well, that sounds great.",40
302,"And so I started doing web design really, really early on.",58
303,"This is like, gosh, I don't know, probably a 1998 vintage during the big boom and then the collapse of the follow.",114
304,"And the funny thing is she worked, she was married to an NSA analyst, a linguist, right?",88
305,And so she lived on Fort Mead and she ran her business out of their home on Fort Mead.,86
306,It's right up the street from the NSA.,38
307,"So before I'm even working there, I'm driving past this building all of the time and trying to figure out, you know, what the next step is going to be.",151
308,And I enjoy this.,17
309,It's a good thing for me and it works well.,43
310,"And I start getting trained and certified all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say, oh, you know this program or whatever.",157
311,And just start climbing the ladder.,35
312,And then 9-11 happens.,22
313,And I'm on Fort Mead when 9-11 happens.,39
314,I'm just going to work.,23
315,"And I tell this in the book, in some detail.",44
316,And I think it's very much worth reading for people who don't know this because this has forgotten history.,107
317,How old were you at the time?,29
318,"No, gosh, I was born in 83.",27
319,So I was probably 18 years old.,31
320,"And yeah, yeah, I had just turned 18 a couple months before.",60
321,"And what people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else on September 11th, the intelligence community, right?",126
322,"And what did they do, right?",28
323,Did they give out a public morning?,35
324,Did they tell you guys to evacuate?,35
325,Did they say do this at her?,28
326,"No, no, not for everybody, not for a long time.",47
327,"But at the NSA, then director of Michael Hayden, he was a general.",66
328,"He later became director of the CIA, ordered the entire campus evacuated of thousands, tens of thousands of people, actually, and just said, go home, right?",156
329,The CIA did the same thing.,27
330,They were running on skeleton crews.,36
331,"At the moment, the country needed them more than they ever had, right?",70
332,"And I get a call, well, and I hear a call that's from my boss's wife, her husband to her.",89
333,"He's calling from the NSA and saying, hey, I think Ed should leave for the day because I'm the only employee of this business besides her.",138
334,Because I think they're going to close the base down.,53
335,"I'm like, this is crazy.",24
336,It never closes down.,21
337,We don't know what's happening.,31
338,"Then we start checking the news, which is through websites, right?",66
339,Because we're doing all this stuff.,35
340,"And suddenly, it's the big story everywhere.",44
341,And nobody understands how big it is yet.,41
342,"Most of us are like, oh, it's going to mess with our workday.",61
343,"Oh, it's going to mess with our commute.",40
344,"But when I'm leaving, I hear car horns all over the base.",57
345,It's the craziest thing.,24
346,"Because this is a military base, right?",39
347,It's right outside the NSA.,27
348,"And I enter just this absolute state of pandemonium as I go past canine road, which is the road that travels right in front of the NSA's headquarters.",150
349,And it's just a parking lot as far as you can see.,50
350,They have military police out under the stoplights directing traffic.,69
351,Because it's this massive actuation.,36
352,"And I still have no idea what's happening, like the story is still developing.",78
353,But I will never forget that image.,35
354,Why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much authority?,80
355,"That at the moments we need them the most, they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings.",114
356,"And later on, they said, and this is covered in a book, I believe.",66
357,"I think it's James Bamford, who interviewed that director of NSA who gave that order about what was happening.",110
358,"He was going, well, he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that.",104
359,"And then after that, he wanted to think about, well, where could these other planes that they knew were in the air that hadn't struck yet?",138
360,Where could they be headed?,27
361,And this sort of shows how self-centric the intelligence community is.,70
362,"This is the DC metro area, right?",33
363,"They get at the White House, they get hit Congress, they get at the Supreme Court, right?",89
364,"And they go, oh, they're going to fly their planes into the CIA headquarters.",77
365,So they're going to fly their planes into the NSA headquarters.,63
366,"And of course, it was never realistic that these would be the targets.",70
367,"But on that basis, they were like, oh, let's get our bacon out of the pan.",74
368,But why don't say this?,23
369,"I'm sorry, but in the interest of what wasn't it possible that they could have attacked those places?",101
370,"I mean, they attacked the Pentagon.",35
371,They knew that there was attacks.,33
372,"Look, it's absolutely possible.",31
373,They could have attacked your denies.,37
374,But it's a question of risk assessment.,39
375,"If you have planes in the air, if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack in the United States right now, and if you have built history's greatest surveillance agencies, right?",184
376,"The most powerful intelligence forces in the history of the species, you are going to take those off the board, or at least the majority of their personnel off the board then, in the chance that you have no sort of grounds for substantiating that they could be targeting you to begin with simply because they could.",315
377,While somebody else will get hit with those.,44
378,"As you say, it's going to be the Pentagon, right?",49
379,It's going to be the World Trade Center.,40
380,It's going to be someone somewhere.,35
381,"And the more minutes you're in front of that desk, the higher the chances, even if it's a very small chance, even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism, right?",168
382,"If it's somebody who normally works finance in North Korea, right?",66
383,"But they go, look, this is emergency.",37
384,Everybody understands you don't need to explain this.,53
385,You just go stop what you're doing.,35
386,Look at financial transactions related to who purchased these plane tickets.,76
387,Do this.,8
388,You just go full spectrum and go anything you can do right now.,63
389,"If the building gets hit, we get hit.",37
390,That's what we signed up for.,29
391,"Nobody wants that, right?",25
392,That's not the desired outcome.,31
393,"But if they had asked the staff to do then, they all would have agreed.",71
394,That's what these people signed up to do.,41
395,"And yet the director goes, no, we're just, just no.",51
396,We're not going to take that right.,35
397,"And this is, I think it says so much about the bureaucratic character of how government works, right?",101
398,The people who rise to the top of these governments.,52
399,"It's about risk management for them, right?",43
400,It's about never being criticized for something.,48
401,"And this is, look, if we want to get really controversial, this is something that'll haunt me because people will bring it up again and again and again.",152
402,"People ask about, you know, people still criticize me.",54
403,"In the book, you know, I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that.",79
404,"And the fact that there, there's no evidence for that.",54
405,"I went looking on the network, right?",37
406,"And I know, Joe, I know.",24
407,You want there to be aliens?,28
408,I do.,5
409,I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens.,58
410,"And there probably are, right?",30
411,"But the idea that we're hiding them, if we are hiding them, I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups.",152
412,"I couldn't find anything, right?",32
413,"So if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside.",112
414,"But the main thing is conspiracy theories, right?",49
415,Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense.,83
416,"It helps us believe that somebody is in control, right?",55
417,"That somebody is calling the shots, that these things all happen for a reason, this, that, and the other.",105
418,"There are real conspiracies, but they're not typically, you know, that they've got tens of thousands of people working on them unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself, which is basically constructed on the idea that you can get, I think there's four million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances.",369
419,"And you can get all of these people to not talk ever, to journalists, to mistatter the other.",93
420,"But when you look back at the 9-11 report, and when you look back at the history of what actually happened, what we can prove, right?",133
421,"Not what we can speculate on, but what are at least the commonly agreed facts.",78
422,"It's very clear to me as someone who worked in the intelligence community, not during this period, of course, I was too young, but very shortly thereafter, that these attacks could have been prevented.",201
423,"And in fact, the government says this too, but the government goes, the reason that they, these attacks happen, the reason that they weren't prevented, is what they call stove piping, right?",190
424,There was not enough sharing.,29
425,They needed to break down the walls and the restrictions that were chaining these poor patriots at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI from all working on the same team.,165
426,"And to some extent, they're correct on this, right?",51
427,"There were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other, but I worked there and I know how much of this is bullshit and how much of this is not.",169
428,"Those are procedural and policy limits, in some cases, legal limits on what can be shared without following a process, without doing this to that or the other, without basically asking for permission without getting a sign off or anything like that.",249
429,"If the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA, they could have done so.",93
430,"If the CIA wanted to send everything they had to the FBI, they could have done so.",82
431,They didn't and people died as a result.,40
432,"Now government goes, bureaucratic procedural realism was responsible and it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community and this is what led to the world post 9-11 where all of our rights sort of evaporated was they went well, restrictions on what these agencies can do are costing lives.",313
433,"Therefore naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better, right?",92
434,"And if you remember that post 9-11 moment, you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive, how that might be a kind of thing to go, you go, all right, well, that makes sense because everybody was terrified, right?",232
435,There were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders the right way.,90
436,"There were some of them who never lost their heads at all and who protested the Iraq war at the same time, my don't self was signing up to go fight it, volunteering for the Army and we're getting into that in a minute.",218
437,"But everything that has followed in the decades past came from the fact that in a moment of fear we lost our heads and we abandoned all the traditional constitutional restraints that we put on these agencies and we abandoned all of the traditional political restraints and just social constraints, ideological systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have in a free and open society.",412
438,"And we went look, you know, terrorists, we created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's like threatening knife people's eyeballs out if they won't tell him this that or the other.",182
439,And we entered this era of increasingly unlimited government as a result.,73
440,"And now in hindsight we go, we should have been surprised.",58
441,"But at the time everyone, everyone panicked, right?",51
442,"But if you go back to, did that help?",37
443,"And we know the answer now is in fact, no, it did not.",54
444,It made things worse.,21
445,I don't think any historian is going to look at the Bush administration and go this improved the position of the United States and the world.,141
446,"But if you go back, you know, wind back the tape to that pre-911 moment, wind back the tape to those silos and those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restraining government.",198
447,"Instead of the rules, they said, well, you can share these things, but there's got to be a basis.",97
448,There's got to be a justification.,34
449,"You've got to go, why are we trading people's information like baseball cards and all of this stuff?",100
450,It's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify sharing information about a suspected terrorist who you think is planning to kill people or is even just in a country they shouldn't be or a place they shouldn't be.,219
451,You're doing something you don't think they should be with another agency because no one's going to question that.,114
452,A judge isn't going to question that.,37
453,Any judge in the world will stand that warrant without even thinking about it and go to bed that night without caring the world because you're not spying on a journalist.,170
454,"You're not spying on a human rights defender, right?",52
455,This is not an edge case.,25
456,This is someone that you believe to be associated with al Qaeda or whatever.,76
457,"Now, this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact.",62
458,Government agrees.,18
459,Everyone agrees the tax probably could have been prevented if information had been shared.,90
460,Why wasn't the information shared?,34
461,Government says information wasn't shared because of these restrictions and it's half true because every important lie has some criminal truth to it.,149
462,And there were these barriers.,30
463,But the reality is why were those barriers respected in the case of a major terrorist plot?,91
464,Why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI?,52
465,Why wasn't the FBI sharing information with the NSA?,52
466,Why was the NSA sharing information with the CIA in the case of a major terrorist plot?,87
467,"And if you've worked in government, if you've worked in the intelligence community, if you work in any large institution, if you work at a company that sells batteries, you know that every office is fighting the other office for budget, for cloud, for promotions.",263
468,And this is the sad reality of what actually happened.,54
469,Every one of those agencies wanted to be the guy who busted the plot.,69
470,They wanted to be the one who got credit for it.,48
471,And they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating with each other.,149
472,That's exactly what I was going to ask you if that was the issue.,65
473,"The competition between these agencies, because they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something or the FBI accomplishing something and they want to be the one to take credit for that.",190
474,Yeah.,5
475,"And I mean, I think it's important to, like, in their defense because nobody else here is going to provide defense for them, is that that's actually darkly human.",162
476,"Again, this happens in every industry.",38
477,"This happens in every sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted and you know, everybody's putting in their like achievements at the end of the year for what they did.",185
478,"And if you're the guy who does that, you're going straight to the top.",70
479,But their solution instead of...,32
480,So we have a weird delay here for folks that are listening.,59
481,"So their solution instead of having someone be responsible for bridging the gap and providing that information to each individual agency, their solution was mass surveillance.",175
482,"Well, no, they're different things.",35
483,"This is 9-11 is what woke these guys up, basically.",51
484,"And they went, well, we screwed up and Americans died as a result.",66
485,We really don't want to take the hit on them.,45
486,"And to be honest, the government had no interest in putting the hit on them.",76
487,"To be honest, the public had no interest in putting the hit on them at the time because everybody understood terrorism is a real thing.",135
488,"There are bad people in the world and that's true, right?",57
489,That will always be true.,25
490,There's always going to be criminals.,37
491,There's always going to be terrorists.,38
492,"Whether they're at your church, whether they're across the ocean, there are people out there who are angry, they're disenfranchised, they're violent, and they just want.",169
493,"To harm something, they want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel is all they have left, which these are criminals, right?",158
494,These are people that we don't need to pity.,44
495,"But if we ever want to stop it, we do need to understand it and where those things come from, where there's drives come from in the first place.",144
496,"But basically everybody went, all right, how do we stop this?",61
497,Because nobody wants to feel unsafe.,36
498,If nobody wants to feel like the building's going to come down to the next time you go in it.,93
499,"And so everybody just went, I don't care who does it, stop it.",62
500,"And they said this to Dick Cheney, which is a historic mistake, because Dick Cheney knows how government works.",111
501,"He was the person in that white house who was best placed to know all the levers of government, all the interagency cooperation, where we were strong, where we were weak, what we could do, what we were not allowed to do.",220
502,"And what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do, and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off.",139
503,And then there was nothing that we couldn't do anymore.,55
504,And you were there?,19
505,This was happening.,19
506,"This was this was this was no I was I was not again, this is 2001.",66
507,I was I was 18 years old.,25
508,I was working on the base.,26
509,"I had drove past the building, but that was it.",47
510,"This is all hindsight, this is biography, this is documented history, but this is not, you know, the gospel of Edward Snow and I, I don't know this, right?",155
511,This is public record.,22
512,This is what we all know.,25
513,"What we have though, the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment, because there's so many people right now in the Trump administration who go look, this guy has too much power.",194
514,"He's abusing it against immigrants, he's abusing it against domestic ponens, he's doing whatever he's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election.",155
515,"All of this stuff, and you know, we can get into this stuff later if you want in detail.",88
516,"But the bottom line is they're going, this is a guy who's in the White House who's throwing elbows, right?",106
517,He doesn't really care.,23
518,"He wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those are the bad guys, right?",100
519,That's the enemy.,17
520,Doesn't matter if they're far away.,35
521,It doesn't matter if they're close at home.,43
522,"Whoever he's against, he's going to harm.",41
523,"The dark thing is, this is actually why he was elected.",55
524,"In moments of fear, where the world starts falling apart, and this happens in a authoritarian country after country, this is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been there for 20 years, right?",200
525,"President, basically 20 years, think about that.",48
526,"You know, he sort of skipped in the middle there because he had to dodge the fact that presidents can only serve somebody consecutive terms, so he dropped down a prime minister and they came back as president.",209
527,But think about that.,21
528,How do you get that kind of political longevity?,48
529,"And it's because if you know anything about Russian history, which, you know, even I don't know that much about it, the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union were an extraordinarily dark time.",197
530,"If you look at Russian cinema, all they had were gangster movies, right?",72
531,"All they had were the disintegration of society, how things are dark and broken, no one trusts each other.",106
532,And the tensions were no longer being paid.,43
533,Social security is not there anymore.,37
534,"Like there's nothing to buy, there's nothing to do, there's no job.",67
535,No one had a future.,20
536,"And so they went, if there's somebody who can lead us out of this, if there's somebody who will fix this, who will find us an enemy and defeat that enemy to restore prosperity, we'll put them in office.",202
537,"We see it happen in Turkey, with Erdogan, right?",48
538,"We've seen it happen, successively with bad governments, even in Western democracies, we see it happening sadly in places like Poland and Hungary.",146
539,"You can even argue it's happening in the United Kingdom, right?",63
540,And now there are a lot of people arguing that's exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's White House in the United States.,128
541,"And this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001, is when we become fearful, we become vulnerable, right?",110
542,"To anyone who promises they will make things better, even if they have no ability to make things better, even if they will actively make things worse, even if they will make things better for themselves and their bodies by taking from you.",239
543,"But if they tell you that they'll make things better, and you believe them in a moment of fear that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes.",140
544,"So sorry, let me turn this back over to you because we got way off track there.",79
545,"No, that's all right.",21
546,I want to bring it back to the initial question.,48
547,So you're working for the NSA.,30
548,When do you realize there's a huge issue and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue?,131
549,Like when do you contact these journalists and what was the thought process regarding this?,91
550,Like what steps did you go through?,35
551,"Once you realize that this was in violation of the Constitution and that even with the laws of the Patriot Act and the Patriot Act 2, things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong.",195
552,And you had to do something about it.,37
553,You felt a responsibility to speak out.,39
554,Okay.,5
555,"So since we gave someone historical preamble, let me just give the Clifnotes version to get us up to that.",106
556,"So after September 11th, I'm a little bit lost.",47
557,"I'm doing my technical stuff, but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore.",81
558,"Like I'm making more money, I'm becoming more accomplished.",59
559,"But the world's on fire, right?",31
560,You remember there was a crazy mood of patriotism in the country because we were all trying to come together and get through it.,128
561,"You remember people were sticking dixie cups on the top of every chain link fence on every overpass that was like, stand together, you know, never forget.",154
562,"Um, United, we stand.",21
563,Flags on every car.,19
564,Exactly.,8
565,"And you know, there was a young guy who is not especially political, right?",75
566,"And I come from a military background, a federal family, all that stuff.",72
567,And so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff.,60
568,So I see it on the news and Bush and all his sort of cronies are going to look.,79
569,"It's al Qaeda, it's terrorism terrorist organization.",53
570,They have all these international connections.,46
571,"There's Iraq, you know, dictators, weapons of mass destruction.",63
572,They're holding the world at ransom.,36
573,You got colon powell at the UN dangling little vials of like fake anthrax.,74
574,And so I felt an obligation to do my part.,42
575,And so I volunteered to join the army.,38
576,"You probably can't tell from looking at me, but I'm not going to be at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon.",111
577,So it didn't work out.,22
578,I joined a special program that was called the 18X Ray program where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at becoming a special forces soldier.,172
579,"So you train harder and special platoon, you go further and I ended up breaking my legs basically.",98
580,So they put me out on the special discharge.,44
581,"Yeah, it was basically what they were shinsplints that I was too dumb to get off of.",84
582,Right.,6
583,So I kept marching underway and I'm a pretty like guy to begin with.,68
584,I had a 24-inch waist when I joined the army.,45
585,Girls are jealous.,18
586,I would.,8
587,Yeah.,5
588,I think I weighed like 128 pounds.,34
589,"I got, I was in great shape in boot camp because I came up really quick because it was all I could do was gain.",111
590,But it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that active.,66
591,"And so when you keep running on a stress entry, right, and you're running under weight with like rucksacks and things like that, you're running in like boots.",158
592,And then you're doing exercise and the army's like a whole chapter in the book.,79
593,"You got your battle buddy, right, because they never allow you to be alone.",75
594,You always got to have somebody watching you.,45
595,They thought it was funny to put me the smallest guy in the platoon that the drill sergeants did with the biggest dude in the platoon who was like an amateur bodybuilder.,170
596,"It was like, you know, 230 or 260 something like that.",54
597,He was a big fellow.,20
598,"And so, you know, he would, when we're off in the woods doing these marches and things like that, we have to practice buddy carries like the fireman's carrying things like that.",177
599,"He throws me around his neck, you know, I'm like a towel.",57
600,He's just skipping down like it's nothing.,42
601,"And then I got to put him on me and I'm just like, oh, God, Diane.",66
602,"It was, it was, it was weirdly fun.",35
603,"I enjoyed it, but it was no good for my body.",45
604,"And so in a land navigation movement, I step off a log, because I was on point.",79
605,"And on the other side of the log, because it's the woods in Georgia, I'm at San Hill, I see a snake.",100
606,"And so in my memory, you know, it's like time slows down, because it's North Carolina, you know, where I grew up, you think all snakes are poisonous.",149
607,That's a myth.,14
608,Okay.,5
609,"Sorry, there's an issue.",24
610,"No, we're good.",15
611,We're good.,11
612,It's completely fine.,21
613,"No, we're fine.",15
614,"I just, there was something that happened on the screen.",56
615,I wanted to make sure it was okay.,34
616,"Oh, that's just me.",19
617,I joined the chat.,18
618,That's what I was worried about.,32
619,There's a second image opened up here.,38
620,Yeah.,5
621,"So anyway, I try to take a much longer step in mid air.",55
622,I land badly.,13
623,And it's just one leg is like fire.,35
624,"I'm lipping, I'm lipping, I'm lipping.",38
625,"But you know, everybody says don't go to sick call, because you go to sick call, you lose your slot, you'll end up general infantry or a regular infantry.",154
626,"And so I go back, I just tough it out.",38
627,"I get my rack in the next morning when I get out of the rack, which is the top bunk bed, right?",95
628,I jump in my legs.,18
629,They just give out underneath me.,33
630,And I try to get up in it.,26
631,I just can't get up.,20
632,And so I go to sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up x-raying me and they also x-rayed my battle buddy because I got to go there with somebody else.,171
633,And he has a broken hip where they had to bring him to surgery.,63
634,And it's in the book.,21
635,There's a lot more detail about it.,35
636,It was kind of dramatic moment.,31
637,"But for me, they just said I had bilateral tibial fractures, right?",67
638,All the way up my legs.,23
639,They said I had spider webs.,28
640,"And the next phrase of the training was jump school, right?",59
641,You got to jump out of a plane.,31
642,"The doctor, you know, is like, son, if you jump on those legs, they're going to turn into powder.",97
643,"And he's like, I can hold you back.",35
644,"We can put you for like six months, you stay off them, then you can go back through the whole cycle, right?",107
645,Start basic from scratch.,25
646,But you'll lose your slot in the special forces pipeline because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that.,128
647,"And then you'll basically be reassigned to the needs of the army, or which probably meant I was going back to IT, which was what I joined the army to kind of escape.",165
648,"Or you can go out on this special kind of discharge that's called an administrative discharge, right?",101
649,"Normally you got honorable discharge, dishonorable discharge, things like that.",79
650,"This is something for people who have been in for I think less than six months, where it's like a mulling a marriage.",117
651,"As if it never happened, this is if you never joined.",53
652,"And at the time I was like, well, you know, that's very kind of him to do that.",79
653,"And I took it, you know, they sent me to sick call, or sort of the sick bay, where you're in like the medical platoon and you do nothing for, it was, I think about a month.",172
654,And then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes.,58
655,"But in hindsight, I realized that if you take it administrative discharge, it exempts the army for liability for your injuries.",127
656,"So actually what I thought was a kindness was just, you know, now if I had future problems with my legs, they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance and any of those things.",180
657,And it was just a funny thing.,30
658,"But anyway, I get out of the army.",34
659,"And here I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out, all right, well, what's next in life?",117
660,"Because I had gotten a basic security clearance just for going through signing up for the military process, I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top secret clearance, which was a higher clearance than I had at the time.",285
661,"And I went, well, that sounds good because I knew if I combined my IT skills, which for now, suddenly much more relevant, again, to my future, with the top secret security clearance because of the way it works.",210
662,"If you have top security clearance and tech skills, you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work.",121
663,"So it was like, all right, well, you know, I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector working for government at this level, at this phase because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the intelligence community changed, they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college, right?",333
664,And I had gotten a GED just by going in and taking a test.,58
665,"So for government purposes, it was the same as if I was a high school graduate.",79
666,So now suddenly it was like these doors were open.,50
667,Now this University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility.,74
668,"It was called a castle, the Center for the Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland College Park.",113
669,"And all I was was literally a security guy walking around with a walkie-talkie making sure nobody breaks in at night, managing the electronic alarm system and things like that.",176
670,"But once I had my foot in the door there, I could start climbing ladder step by step.",85
671,"And I applied for, or I went to a job fair actually that was only for people who had security clearances.",105
672,And I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies.,69
673,It was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of.,58
674,"And they said, you know, we've got tons of positions for somebody like you.",75
675,Are you comfortable working nights?,35
676,"And I was like, yeah, you know, I wake up in the middle of the day anyway.",74
677,That's fine with me.,20
678,"And suddenly, I've gone from working for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like the NSA holds the clearance, but I'm formally an employee of the state of Maryland at the college.",199
679,"And this is government, man.",28
680,It's all these weird dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there.,78
681,"Now, suddenly, I'm working at CIA headquarters, right?",54
682,"The place where all the movies show, you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that.",93
683,"I'm the king of the castle, right?",34
684,"And there at the middle of the night, when no one else is there, the lights are on motion sensors.",98
685,It's the creepiest thing in the world.,38
686,"There's like flags on the wall that are just like gently building in the air conditioning, like ghosts.",103
687,The hallway lights up as you walk alongside it because it's like a green building and they disappear behind you.,112
688,And there's no one there.,25
689,I can go down to the gym at like two o'clock in the morning at the CIA.,71
690,And it's like not see a soul on the other side of the building and then go all the way back.,92
691,"And this kind of thing was was my end because they were like, look, it's the night shift.",89
692,Nothing that bad is going to happen.,36
693,But it was on a very senior technical team.,43
694,"That was basically handling systems administration for everybody in the Washington, Mesopotamia, right?",103
695,So every basically CIA server.,30
696,This is a computer system that like data is stored on.,54
697,The reporting is stored on.,27
698,The traffic has moved on all of this stuff.,43
699,Suddenly me.,12
700,"This is circa 2005, I think.",28
701,I'm in charge of and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift.,71
702,"And if you're interested in the book, there's a lot of detail on this.",70
703,But I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology.,105
704,They were expecting me just basically make sure the building doesn't burn down.,79
705,All these systems don't go down overnight and then never come back up.,70
706,"But they go, well, are you willing to go overseas?",50
707,"And to a young man at that age, that's actually like, hey, that sounds kind of exciting.",88
708,"You know, who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA?",59
709,"And there's a lot of people listening to podcasts who are like, not me.",71
710,"I'm wondering what I'm going to be like, wait, the CIA is the bad guys, right?",78
711,"Yeah, exactly.",14
712,"They're like, well, you're going to go overthrow a government somewhere.",72
713,But you have to understand that I'm still very much a true believer.,68
714,"The government is like the living compressed embodiment of truth and goodness and light, you know, the shining city on the hill.",128
715,So I want to do my part to spread that to the world.,52
716,I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here.,69
717,"And so I sign up and I go through this special training school like people here in movies about the farm, which is down at Camp Piri in Virginia.",145
718,"I'm sent to this actually much more secret facility called the hill, which isn't more in Virginia.",98
719,And this has been covered a few times in open source media.,59
720,But I think this is one of the few book length discussions of what happens there in primary record.,99
721,"But yeah, so I go through training and then I get assigned overseas and I end up in Geneva, Switzerland, undercover as a diplomat, right?",137
722,"I think my formal title for the embassy is like something super bland, like diplomatic attaché.",95
723,And what I am is I'm a forward deployed tech guy.,49
724,"They send you through this school to make you into kind of a me guiver, right?",78
725,"Yes, you can handle all the computers, but you can also handle the connections for the embassy's power systems, right?",118
726,The actual electric connections.,32
727,"You can handle the HVAC systems, right?",39
728,You can handle locks and alarms and security systems.,53
729,Basically anything that's got an on button on it at the embassy that's secure now you're responsible for.,105
730,And I traveled from Geneva to other countries in Europe for sort of assignments.,80
731,And it was like it was an exciting time.,40
732,"I actually still enjoyed it, but this was where I first working with intelligence started to get doubts.",104
733,"The story's been told many times, so I won't go over in full detail here.",73
734,"But the CIA does primarily, and it's not the only thing they do, what's called human intelligence.",98
735,"Now there are many different types of intelligence, the intelligence community is responsible for.",98
736,The primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence.,65
737,"You want to think of signals intelligence, right?",49
738,"As tapping lines, hacking computers, all of these sort of things that provide electronic information, anything that's digital or analog signal that can be intercepted and then turned into information.",200
739,"Human intelligence is all that fun stuff we've heard the CIA doing for decades and decades, which is where they try to turn people.",131
740,"Basically they say, look, we'll give you money if you sell out your country.",76
741,It's not even your country.,27
742,A lot of times it's your organization.,38
743,These guys could be working for telecommunications provider and they want to sell customer records over.,104
744,"They worked at a bank, which was the thing that I saw and we wanted records on the bank's customers, so we wanted a guy on the inside.",134
745,"But anyway, that's sort of how it works.",40
746,What I saw was they were way more aggressive for the lowest stakes than was reasonable or responsible.,102
747,They were totally willing to destroy somebody's life.,53
748,"Just on the off chance, they would get some information that wouldn't even be tremendously valuable.",100
749,"And so, ethically, that struck me as a bit off, but I let it pass because what I've learned over my life short though it's been.",128
750,It's that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time.,67
751,"It's a skill, something that needs to be practiced or you can think of it as something that you develop through exposure.",121
752,"I kind of like a radiation poisoning, but in a positive way.",60
753,It's when you start to realize inconsistencies or hypocrisies or lies.,70
754,And you notice them and you give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them or you think it's all right.,113
755,"But then over time, you see it's not an isolated instance.",58
756,It's a pattern behavior and over time that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore.,149
757,"Now after the CIA, I went to the NSA in Japan where I was working there in Tokyo.",81
758,"And then from there, a couple of years later, I went to the CIA again.",70
759,"Now I was working as private employee for Dell, but I was the senior technical official on Dell's sales account, the CIA.",121
760,"These big companies, they have sales accounts to the CIA.",57
761,And so this means I'm going in and now it's crazy because I'm still a very young man.,85
762,But I'm sitting across the table from chiefs of these enormous CIA divisions.,77
763,I'm sitting across from their chief technology officer for the entire agency or the chief intelligence or chief information officer for the entire CIA.,151
764,"And these guys are going, look, here's our problems, here's what we want to do.",79
765,"And it's my job to pitch them a system, right?",46
766,And I'm paired up with the sales guy.,37
767,"And the whole thing is just go how much money can we get out of the government, right?",86
768,"Because the whole goal, and we'll build them what we were pitching was a private cloud system, right?",101
769,Everybody knows about cloud computing now.,42
770,It's like why your Gmail account is available wherever you go.,62
771,It's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere.,77
772,The government wanted to have these kind of capabilities too.,61
773,Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon.,41
774,"People, some people aren't familiar with this, many of them are.",64
775,But Amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government.,57
776,I forget what they've rebranded it now.,39
777,"But this is just, there's this massive connection between industry and government and the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.",162
778,"But at this point, I was already, I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government.",102
779,But I was just trying to get by.,32
780,I was trying to ignore the conflicts.,37
781,I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies.,43
782,"And I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions, not just in our country, but around the world, struggle with every day, right?",156
783,They got a job.,15
784,They got a family.,18
785,They got bills.,15
786,They're just trying to get by.,30
787,And they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things.,72
788,They know some of the things they're doing are actively wrong.,62
789,But they know what happens to people who rock the boat.,55
790,"Eventually, I changed my mind.",30
791,"And when I had gone to Hawaii, which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community, I was, because of an accident of history here, I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all.",201
792,I was supposed to be at a group called the National Threat Operations Center Endoc.,83
793,"But because of the way contracting works, and again, this is covered in the book, I ended up being reassigned to this little rinky dank office that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the Office of Information Sharing.",222
794,"And I'm replacing this old timer who's about to retire, really, really nice guy.",80
795,But he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact that they're letting people forget that his office existed because he was the only one in it.,203
796,"There's a manager who's like over him, but it's actually over a larger group and he just looks over him as sort of a favor.",123
797,So now I come in.,17
798,"And now I'm the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, but I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm okay with just doing nothing at all.",152
799,So I get ambitious.,19
800,And I come up with this idea for a new system called the heartbeat.,67
801,"And what the heartbeat is going to do is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community, both at the NSA and across network boundaries, which you normally can't cross, but because I'd worked at both the CIA and the NSA, I knew the network well enough, both sides of it, sides that normal workers at the NSA would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other.",405
802,I can actually connect these together.,38
803,I could build bridges across this kind of network space.,56
804,And then draw all of these records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID.,106
805,"Basically your sort of ID card that says, this is who I am.",59
806,I work for this agency.,23
807,I work in this office.,22
808,These are my assignments.,25
809,These are my group affiliations.,32
810,"And because of that, the system would be able to eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job that were related to you.",134
811,And then it could provide them.,31
812,And basically you could hit this site.,38
813,"It would be an update of what we used to call rebords, which were manually created.",83
814,"Then we go, look, you work in network defense.",46
815,These are all the things that are happening on network defense.,63
816,"You work on, I don't know, economic takeovers in Guatemala.",59
817,"You know, if this is what's going on for you there.",51
818,"But in my off time, I helped the team that sat next to me, which was a systems administration team for Windows networks because I had been Microsoft certified systems engineer, which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks.",243
819,And this was all those guys did.,32
820,"And they always had way too much work, way too much work.",57
821,"And I had basically no work that I needed to do at all because all I was supposed to do was share information, which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed.",237
822,So it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious.,100
823,And so I did some side gigs for these other guys.,49
824,And one of them was running what were called dirty word searches.,65
825,"Now dirty word searches are, let me dial this back because I know we're sort of, this is hard to track.",103
826,Everything that the NSA does in large part is classified.,57
827,Everything the CIA does in large part is classified.,52
828,"If I made lunch plans with other people in my office, it was classified.",72
829,That was the policy.,20
830,It's dumb.,10
831,This over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now.,85
832,"This is the reason we don't understand, but they're doing this is why they can get a wrong way.",95
833,"This is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long, you know, five years, 10 years, 15, 50 years before they see, before we see what they were doing.",186
834,"And it's because of this routine classification, right?",55
835,"But every system, computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it.",117
836,And we've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveats that establish a system of what's called compartmentation.,129
837,And this is the idea.,21
838,"When you work at the CIA, when you work at the NSA, you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you, right?",130
839,"Because you don't have need to know, right?",43
840,"Again, that thing from the movies.",34
841,"And the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything, right?",104
842,Tell everybody everything.,26
843,"They don't want anybody to know too much, particularly when they're doing lots of bad things.",93
844,Because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify.,125
845,And they might develop sort of an ideological objection to that.,64
846,"Well in the office of information sharing and actually in basically every part of my career before that, I had access to everything.",132
847,"I had what was called a special caveat on my access is called privac, which means privileged access.",100
848,What this means is you're a kind of super user.,47
849,Most people have all of these controls on the kind of information they can access.,82
850,"But I've been charged with the system, right?",45
851,"People who need information, they have to get it from somewhere.",64
852,They don't know.,16
853,"Even the director of the CIA, right?",36
854,"He says, I need to know everything about this.",46
855,"Well, he doesn't know where to get it.",38
856,He's just a manager.,20
857,Somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things.,80
858,That guy was me.,16
859,And so dirty word searches were these kind of automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartmentation and exceptionally controlled information.,235
860,"That's kind of, you could think of it as above top secret in these special compartments, right?",95
861,Where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for.,71
862,"You only know the code word unless you work in them, unless you have access to them, unless you're read into them.",114
863,"One day, I got a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called Stellar Wind.",104
864,"It came back because the little caveat for it, they're called handling caveats, which is like, you know, you can think of like burn after reading or for your eyes only.",168
865,"But this one's called STLW, which means Stellar Wind.",53
866,"Unless you know what Stellar Wind is, you don't know how to handle it.",70
867,All I knew was it wasn't supposed to be on my system.,53
868,"You know what, this is a little bit unusual.",44
869,And it turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii.,149
870,"And this person was a lawyer, I believe.",40
871,"And they had worked in the Inspector General's office and they had compiled a report, part of the Inspector General's report, which is when the government is investigating itself.",179
872,"And to the operations and activities of this program, well, this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation that started under the Bush White House.",210
873,Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation.,62
874,It had been unveiled in a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times by a journalist James Ryzen.,105
875,And I'm not going to name him because I don't want to get wrong.,64
876,"Another journalist you can look at the byline, if you want to see their involvement.",84
877,But there's a lot of history here too.,38
878,"But what they had found was, of course, the Bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program, if you remember, the warrantless wiretapping scandal.",165
879,There was effecting everyone in the United States.,50
880,"Well, the Bush White House was really put in a difficult position by this scandal.",82
881,"They would have lost the election over this scandal because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004, which was the election year they were ready to go with it.",178
882,"But at the specific request of the White House, talking to the publisher of the New York Times, Salzberger and Bill Keller, then the executive editor of the New York Times, the New York Times said, we won't run the story because the president just said, if you run this story a month before the election, that's very tight margin, if you recall, you'll have blood on your hands.",378
883,"And it was so close to 2001, the New York Times just went, you know what, fine.",79
884,The politicians don't need to know that the Constitution is being violated.,75
885,They don't need to know that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means.,88
886,"If the government says it's all right and it's the secret and you shouldn't know about it, that's fine.",103
887,"Now, December 2005, why did that change?",40
888,Why did the New York Times suddenly run this story?,51
889,"Well, it's because James Ryzen, the reporter who found this story, had written a book and he was about to publish this book.",124
890,And the New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalists.,174
891,"And so they finally did it, but it was too late.",48
892,Bush had been reelected.,24
893,And now it was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights.,63
894,"So Congress, the Bush White House was very effective in, as I said before, telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed.",147
895,"And they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to, but made them culpable for hiding the existence of the program from the American people.",166
896,"And this is why someone like Nancy Pelosi, who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy butty with George Bush, was completely okay in defending this kind of program, in fact.",176
897,"And you know, later she said, oh, well, she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the White House, but she never showed us the letter.",156
898,"She went, oh, well, that was classified, right?",47
899,And this is not to bag on her individually.,43
900,It's just she's a great example in here and not named example everyone knows of how this process works.,103
901,The White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity.,104
902,"And so when the, when then when the White House gets in trouble for it, the Congress has to run cover for the White House.",122
903,"And so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America Act, which should have been our first indication.",142
904,This is a very bad thing because they never name a law something like that unless it's something terrible.,106
905,"And what it did was it retroactively immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government, which they weren't allowed to do, simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying, please do this.",306
906,"And these companies went, look, now that we've been uncovered, now that we've been shown that we're breaking or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans and a staggering scale, they could bankrupt our companies because we can be sued for this.",303
907,We will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this.,110
908,"And so we get the Protect America Act, which they say is an emergency.",70
909,This is all public history too.,31
910,"You can look this up on Wikipedia, you know?",44
911,"And so then they go, it's an emergency law.",43
912,We have to pass this now.,25
913,We have to keep this program active.,36
914,Bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's going to have some special level oversight and these kind of things.,177
915,"Eventually, but for now, we just have to make sure people are safe.",67
916,"Again, they go to fear.",23
917,"They say if we don't have this program, terrorist attacks, we'll continue.",74
918,"You know, people will die.",26
919,"Blood on your hands, blood on your hands, blood on your hands, think of the children.",85
920,Protect America Act passes.,27
921,The companies get off the hook.,31
922,The Bush White House gets off the hook.,39
923,The Congress that was then sharing in criminal culpability for authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them.,134
924,"Then passes in 2008, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, amendments of 2008, this is called the FAA FISA Amendments Act of 2008.",135
925,"And rather than stopping all of the unlawful and sort of unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing, they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal hoops for them to jump through.",223
926,Now this is not to say these things aren't helpful at all.,58
927,It's not to say they're not useful at all.,42
928,"But it's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal, and this applies to any country, is not to make the activities of the person who's caught breaking the law comply with the law, but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law legal.",284
929,They make the law comply with what the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law.,109
930,That's a problem.,17
931,And that's what happened here.,30
932,Now the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008 because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with.,178
933,There were objections.,22
934,"There were people who knew this was a bad idea, but it passed on.",65
935,"Now what the public took away from this because a part of these laws was a requirement that the inspector general of all of these different intelligence community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying, this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program.",303
936,"This is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law and basically looked back at how this program was constituted, what it did, what the impacts and effects were, and that was supposed to be sort of the truth and reconciliation council, right?",265
937,Now why am I talking about all this ancient history?,52
938,"Well, I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified inspector general's report, draft report from the NSA, that names names that says Dick Cheney, that says David Gattington, that says Nancy Pelosi, that says all these people who are involved in the program, the TikTok of how it happens, it says the director of the NSA, that guy who is evacuating the building at the beginning of our podcast here.",396
939,"That guy was asked by the President of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of Justice that these programs were not lawful, that they were not constitutional.",228
940,"The President said, would you continue this program on my say so alone knowing that it's risky, knowing that it's unlawful, and he said, yes sir, I will, if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe.",216
941,"At that moment, I realize these guys don't care about the law.",62
942,"These guys don't care about the Constitution, these guys don't care about the American people, they care about the continuity of government, they care about the state, right?",174
943,This is something that people have lost.,40
944,"We hear this phrase over and over again, national security, national security, national security, and we're meant to interpret that to mean public safety.",154
945,But national security is a very different thing from public safety.,67
946,National security is a thing that in previous generations we referred to as state security.,91
947,National security was a kind of term that came out of the Bush administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police across the country.,174
948,"And what does it mean when, again, in a democracy in the United States, the public is not partner to government.",112
949,"The public does not hold the leash of government anymore, but we are subject to government, right?",98
950,We are subordinate to government.,33
951,And we're not even allowed to know that it happened.,52
952,"Now, in the book, I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan.",109
953,"And what's interesting is the unclassified version of a report, and we've all seen this today with things like the Mueller report, the model of the intelligence reporting that's happened to the last several years, when the government provides a classified report to the public.",277
954,"It's normally the same document, the unclassified version, the classified version of the same thing, just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say, oh, you're not allowed to know this sentence with this paragraph or this page or whatever.",271
955,The document that the public had been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document.,122
956,It was a document tailor made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States.,102
957,And it was effective in doing that.,35
958,"And in 2012, what I realized was this is what real world conspiracies look like, right?",87
959,"It doesn't have to be smoking men behind closed doors, right?",61
960,It's lawyers and politicians.,29
961,"It's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go, if we don't explain this in a certain way, we're all going to lose our jobs or the other way they go, we're going to get something out of this if we all work together.",243
962,"Civilization is the history of conspiracy, right?",49
963,"What is civilization but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together, right?",92
964,But it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell.,89
965,"I want all your listeners, right?",33
966,To go to the Washington Post because this document that I discovered that really changed me has been published courtesy of the Washington Post.,143
967,It's called the Inspector General's Report on Stellar Wind.,59
968,"And you can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted, right?",78
969,I had no blacked out pages online.,34
970,And what I believe it shows is that some of the most senior officials in the United States elected and unelected worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded powers.,220
971,"Now in their defense, they said they were seeking these powers for a good and just a noble cause, right?",104
972,They say they were trying to keep us safe.,42
973,But that's what they always say.,32
974,That's what every government says.,34
975,That's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says.,89
976,"And the question is, if they are truly keeping us safe, why wouldn't they simply just tell us that?",99
977,Why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress?,47
978,Why wouldn't they put that to a vote?,37
979,"Because if they were and they could convince us that they were, they'd win the vote.",84
980,"And particularly we all know, like the Patriot Act passed, more of the worst pieces of legislation of honor has repast.",119
981,Why didn't we get a vote?,25
982,"And I think if you read the report, the answer will be clear.",61
983,"So I'm sorry, Joy.",18
984,I went on for a very long time.,31
985,"No, it was amazing.",19
986,"It's actually done, done, apologies at all.",43
987,It's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion.,132
988,"That is so much more, much more, much more.",43
989,"But right, right.",17
990,Literally the president.,24
991,At the heart of it.,19
992,Yes.,4
993,At the heart of it.,19
994,"In every expression of executive power, right?",46
995,"And by executive, we mean the White House here.",47
996,"The CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the DOJ, right?",42
997,These guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government.,65
998,"In a real way, they work for the White House.",45
999,Now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that.,161
1000,"But when you look at federal regulations, when you look at policies as an employee of government, and you violate these policies, the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws.",255
1001,"And so it's very easy for people who exist in these structures, particularly the very top levels of these structures, to go look, we have a given set of lawful authorities.",172
1002,And these are defined very broadly to give us leeway to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just.,118
1003,"Now take that proper and appropriate and just from the perspective of any given individual, right, any given president.",119
1004,Now intersect that with what's good for them politically.,57
1005,And that's where problems begin to arise.,41
1006,Now the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the US system and in democracy broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials.,173
1007,That means we know their decisions.,35
1008,That means we know their policies.,34
1009,That means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers like what they are doing both in our name and what they're doing against us.,138
1010,"And because they are transparent to us, we the people can then police their activities.",87
1011,We can go and disagree with this.,33
1012,We can protest it.,18
1013,"We can campaign against it, right?",34
1014,We can try to become the president do whatever.,47
1015,They are public officials and we are private citizens.,54
1016,"They're not supposed to know anything about us, right?",54
1017,Because we in relative terms hold no power and they hold all the power.,71
1018,So they have to be under the tightest constraints we need to be in the freest circumstances.,92
1019,"And yet the rise of the state secret stock trend, right?",56
1020,This whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century about the middle of the last century I believe is when it really started getting tested in court.,173
1021,And I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA's sort of old dirty work in the 20th century.,184
1022,They abused their powers repeatedly and continuously.,53
1023,They did active harm to domestic politics in the United States.,63
1024,The FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded.,141
1025,"In fact after MLK gave his, I have a dream speech.",50
1026,Two days later the FBI classified him as the greatest national or I think it was the greatest national security threat in the United States.,140
1027,And again this is the FBI.,26
1028,This is the group that everybody's applauding today saying all these wonderful patriots and heroes.,99
1029,Now I'm not saying everybody the FBI is bad.,44
1030,"I'm not saying anybody, everybody the CIA and the NSA is bad.",61
1031,I'm saying that you don't become a patriot based on where you work.,67
1032,Patriotism is not about loyalty to government.,46
1033,Patriotism in fact is not about loyalty to anything.,52
1034,Patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country.,74
1035,Right.,6
1036,It's not about the government.,30
1037,It's not about the state.,25
1038,"And this is, we'll get into loyalty later because I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be talked about is they go look this guy is a disloyal, he broke a note, he did whatever.",196
1039,"Loyalty, loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good, but it is only good when it's in the service of something good.",140
1040,"If you're loyal to a bad person, if you're loyal to a bad program, if you're loyal to a bad government, that loyalty is actively harmful.",137
1041,And I think that's overlooked.,30
1042,"But yeah, when you get back into this whole thing about sort of where it came from, why it happened, how it could come out of just this small group, and then they could slowly kind of poison by implication, by complicity, by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it, wider and wider, broad body of people.",345
1043,"And then once you've got enough people in on it, it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate because they can go look, we've got 30 people who know about this.",178
1044,And none of them have objected to it.,37
1045,Why are you going to object to this?,36
1046,"All of this derives from that original sin, which is in a democracy creating a system of government that is in fact a secret, a body of secret law, a body of secret policy that is far beyond what legitimate government secrets could be.",235
1047,This is not say like government can have no secrecy at all.,59
1048,"The government wants to investigate someone without having them respond, right?",79
1049,We're talking traditional law enforcement.,42
1050,"Sure, you're not going to tell this mobster, hey, we're going to start investigating you.",89
1051,"We the public don't need to know the names of every terrorist suspect out in the world, but we do need to know, again, the powers and programs, the policies that a government is asserting, at least the broad outlines of it because otherwise how can we control it?",263
1052,How do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing?,152
1053,"So this is the main thing and really the story behind the title, permanent record, is look, Joe, when you were a kid, when I was a kid, when you were a teenager, right?",168
1054,What's the worst thing you ever said?,37
1055,Did you say anything you weren't proud of?,42
1056,Did you do anything that you weren't proud of?,46
1057,"Something that today, in like the wokest of Twitter land, you would get in trouble for.",87
1058,I'm sure.,9
1059,And that's one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever and they can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13.,208
1060,It's exactly that.,18
1061,"Our worst mistakes, our deepest shames were forgotten, right?",61
1062,They were lost.,15
1063,They were ephemeral.,20
1064,"Even the things we did get caught for, they were known for a time.",66
1065,"Maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us, whether we like them or dislike them, but they were people connected to us now.",143
1066,We're forced to live in a real way naked before power.,54
1067,"Whether we're talking about Facebook, whether we're talking about Google, whether we're talking about the government of any country, they know everything about us or much about us rather.",187
1068,And we know very little about them and we're not allowed to know more.,70
1069,"Everything that we do now lasts forever, not because we want to remember, but because we're not allowed to forget, just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be more realized because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that.",274
1070,"And AT&T keeps those records going back to 2008, under a program called Hemisphere, if you search for Hemisphere in AT&T, you'll get a story in the Daily Beast about it.",169
1071,AT&T keeps your phone records going back to 1983.,49
1072,"If any of your listeners were born after 1983, born after me, or it might be 1987, excuse me, 1987.",99
1073,They're born after 1987 and they're AT&T customer or their calls cross AT&T network.,84
1074,AT&T has every phone call they ever made.,41
1075,"Rather, the record that it happened, not necessarily the contents on the phone call.",84
1076,"And so, I mean, let me turn this around for you, Joe, because I feel like I've just been given a speech.",104
1077,"When you look at this stuff, right, when you look at what's happening with government, when you look at what's happening with the Trump White House, the Obama White House, the Bush White House, you could see this trend happening.",229
1078,"When you look at what's happening with Facebook, when you look at what's happening with Google, when you look at the fact that you go to every restaurant today, and you see people look at the phones, you know, you get on a bus, you get on a subway, you know, you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic, you see people looking at phones.",341
1079,These devices are connected all the time.,41
1080,"Now people are getting Alexa, right?",36
1081,"Now people have OK Google, they have Siri on their phones, they're in their house.",82
1082,They've always got these connected microphones.,47
1083,Where do you think this leads?,30
1084,And what is it that gives you sort of trust in the system faith and the system?,79
1085,"Like how, just so we can start a conversation here, what strikes you about this?",80
1086,"Well, it's completely alien and it's new.",41
1087,This is something that's unprecedented.,39
1088,We don't have a long human history of being completely connected via technology.,80
1089,This is something we're navigating right now for the first time.,64
1090,And it's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information.,120
1091,There's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history and we're figuring out as we go along.,106
1092,"And what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along, but that to cover their ass, these cell phone companies and cooots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls, all of your text messages, all of your emails and store them somewhere so that retroactively, if you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like, they can go back, find that and use it against you.",446
1093,"And we don't know who they are, we don't know why they're doing it and we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it.",124
1094,"The connection of human beings via technology is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge, but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements, track your phone calls, track everything.",244
1095,"And under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells, protecting us from attacks.",118
1096,"Look, they really are protecting us from these attacks.",55
1097,That's great.,13
1098,But there's no provision in the constitution that allows any of this.,69
1099,And this is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules as they go along and they're making up these rules the way you're describing it.,159
1100,It is step by step.,19
1101,This has happened to sort of protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacy and the Fourth Amendment.,173
1102,"Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that everybody needs to understand, when you look at these things, and the reason we talked about before, when I got this information, why I didn't just put it on the Internet, and people criticized me for this, they go, I didn't share enough information because the journalists are gatekeeping, right?",342
1103,They've got a big archive and they haven't published everything from it.,72
1104,And I told them not to publish everything.,42
1105,Why did you do that?,20
1106,Why did you do that?,20
1107,"Because so again, it gets back to legitimate secrets and illegitimate secrets.",78
1108,"Some spying from my perspective, you know, career spy is okay, right?",69
1109,Agreed.,7
1110,"If you have hacked a terrorist's phone, right?",46
1111,And you're getting some information about that useful.,54
1112,Agreed.,7
1113,Yeah.,5
1114,"If you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a rocket division, useful, right?",84
1115,But there are lines and degrees in that where it's not useful.,62
1116,"Now the examples that I just gave you, these are targeted.",58
1117,This is where you're spying on an individual.,45
1118,They're a known named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is related for more people.,105
1119,Hopefully for more.,19
1120,Right.,6
1121,"Well, even for foreign intelligence and some indications, you don't need a warrant strictly.",92
1122,"Although I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the Foreign Intelligence Survey, right?",180
1123,Yeah.,5
1124,"And there's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying, hey, spy on Abu Jihad over here, right?",113
1125,"And if you want to spy on another guy, Boris Badenov, or the rocket division, right, that's okay.",97
1126,They're going to go with that.,30
1127,But then you look at these edge cases in the archive that I provided to journalists.,84
1128,"There have been stories that have come down where they've spied on journalists, right?",86
1129,They've spied on human rights groups.,37
1130,"And these kind of things, I think people miss.",46
1131,I'm going to throw up some slides here.,39
1132,So forgive me if this gets weird and I put up the wrong ones.,61
1133,"But since I came forward, this foreign intelligence surveillance court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program.",203
1134,"These are federal courts here, right?",37
1135,"That said, no, actually these programs are unlawful.",52
1136,They're likely unconstitutional.,32
1137,And you start looking at the facts.,35
1138,"You see, even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance, they say they broke their own laws, you know, 2,776 times in a single year.",188
1139,And then you ask about that thing that motivates me like why I came forward.,76
1140,We had been trying as a country before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs legally.,103
1141,"Because this is our means of last sort of recourse in our system, right?",72
1142,"We get the executive, we get the legislature, we got the judiciary, right?",74
1143,"So Congress makes the laws, the executive is supposed to carry them out, the courts are supposed to play referee.",113
1144,The executive had broken the laws.,34
1145,Congress was turning a blind eye to the laws.,45
1146,"And the courts were, and this is just months before I came forward, going, well, it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International, like all of these human rights groups and non-governmental organizations, had established that, you know, these programs are likely unlawful.",278
1147,They likely exist.,18
1148,They're simply classified.,26
1149,"But the government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that, well, it's a state secret if they do exist.",122
1150,"You, the plaintiffs, don't have hard concrete evidence that they do exist.",74
1151,"And the government is saying legally you have no right to discover evidence from the government, write documents, demand documents, or demand and answer from the government as to whether things, these, or as to whether or not these things exist.",245
1152,"Because the government's just going to give, it's standard what they call glomer response.",90
1153,"We can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist, which leaves you out of the cold, which leaves the courts out in the cold.",131
1154,"The courts go, look, the government could be breaking the law here.",67
1155,"Look, they could be violating the Constitution here, but because you can't prove it and because the government doesn't want to play ball and the government says, if we were doing this, the court would be legal and it would be necessary for national security or whatever.",270
1156,The court can't presume to know national security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected.,110
1157,"And so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where, okay, the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist.",170
1158,"But the programs are classified, so you can't establish they exist unless you have evidence, but providing that evidence to courts, to journalists, to anyone is a felony, right?",177
1159,That's punishable by 10 years per count under the Espionage Act.,64
1160,"And the government has charged every source of public interest journalism who's really made a significant difference in these kind of cases since Daniel Ellsberg, really going back to that, under the same Espionage Act.",219
1161,It's always the same law.,25
1162,"And there's no distinction to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government for private benefit, right?",132
1163,Or whether you provide an information only to journalists for the public interest.,82
1164,"And then that's a fundamentally harmful thing, I think.",55
1165,"When you look at things that have come in the wake of this, we're talking about the post-2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful, you see the courts saying actually that leaks or air quotes leaks can actually be beneficial.",256
1166,Leak is used in the government.,31
1167,And this is from a federal court.,33
1168,These are not exactly my biggest supporters.,44
1169,"They are recognizing that although leak implies harm, it implies something that's broken, it's actually helpful.",112
1170,It's a leak that's letting in daylight in this context.,55
1171,"That is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward, we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen.",163
1172,We had hang on.,15
1173,"This famous exchange, which more than anything, made me realize this was a point of no return.",94
1174,"Because I've told you this, you've heard this.",46
1175,"But if you haven't seen it, you might not believe me, right?",60
1176,"Maybe I'm a sketchy guy, whatever.",34
1177,"One of those senators I told you that objected to this stuff that was doing the Lassie barks for all those years, Ron Wyden, was confronting the most senior spy in the United States, General James Clapper, who was then the director of national intelligence, right?",264
1178,There's no guy higher than him.,31
1179,The buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence.,54
1180,"He's testifying under oath in front of Congress, right?",55
1181,"But more broadly, in front of the public, this is televised.",60
1182,And Ron Wyden asked him a very specific question about a program mind you that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance.,136
1183,He sits on the intelligence committee.,38
1184,And he knows there's domestic mass surveillance.,48
1185,And this is how it goes.,24
1186,This is how the top spy responds under oath.,44
1187,"So what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all, millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?",176
1188,"No, sir.",8
1189,It does not.,12
1190,Not wittingly.,14
1191,"There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.",82
1192,So that was a lie.,18
1193,Wyden knew it was a lie.,24
1194,Clapper knew it was a lie.,26
1195,He actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward three months later.,74
1196,But he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there.,117
1197,But what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress?,78
1198,"And the congressman even knows you're lying to them, but they're afraid to correct you.",87
1199,"And Wyden, by the way, it wasn't a surprise.",44
1200,Wyden gave him those questions 24 hours in advance.,51
1201,"And he wrote a letter afterwards asking for Clapper to amend his testimony, right?",82
1202,"Not even at a press conference, but just say this was incorrect, whatever.",74
1203,So he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressman that there was a problem and the thing you need to do it.,130
1204,But all of that was refused to us.,34
1205,All of it was denied to us.,27
1206,And here I am sitting at the NSA.,33
1207,Next to my buddies who I've talked to about these programs.,59
1208,"You know, I've gone, look at this and they're laughing at it.",61
1209,"You know, I'm laughing at it.",29
1210,"And it's not that we go, oh, he's getting away with it.",55
1211,"It's like, what are you going to do?",36
1212,"These guys are, you know, they're bullshitters that the system is built on lies that even many people, many experts who have studied this know our lies.",152
1213,"But if you can't prove their lies, how do you move beyond that?",63
1214,And that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House.,118
1215,So you're in this position where you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional.,146
1216,And you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this.,81
1217,What makes you take the leap?,29
1218,So this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time.,71
1219,I would imagine.,16
1220,"People, you know, yeah, right.",30
1221,Exactly.,8
1222,People like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document like the seller went report.,112
1223,And that's the closest thing to a smoking gun that exists.,58
1224,"But look, if you found that you can read that later, look at that and like imagine yourself being like, oh, I'm going to go outside on the courthouse steps and wave this thing and burn my life to the ground, burn my family to the ground.",237
1225,I'm going to be work again.,27
1226,I'm going to jail for the rest of my life.,42
1227,The question is what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground?,93
1228,"For a long time, too long.",26
1229,The answer was nothing.,23
1230,And I'm ashamed of that.,24
1231,It took me so long to get over that home because I was waiting for somebody else to do it.,90
1232,"When I saw people like Ron Wyden on this, when I saw people like the court case that I showed before where people were actively challenging these programs, right?",162
1233,Journalists had the scent of it.,32
1234,"And you know, there are a lot of people who are going to be in the YouTube comments or whatever going, oh, I knew this was happening.",133
1235,"No, you did.",12
1236,Bill Biny.,10
1237,You had Bill Biny.,18
1238,Bill Biny.,10
1239,"Bill Biny, he initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue.",77
1240,"And so, yeah, Bill Biny is a part of who shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake, Bill Biny, Kirk Weebie, I believe an Ed Lumas.",166
1241,And these guys all got their doors kicked in.,45
1242,"You know, they got harassed by the FBI Tom Drake, who was a senior executive at the NSA.",88
1243,"This is a guy who had a lot to lose, was charged under the same law.",68
1244,I was the espionage act.,24
1245,And these guys were doing it earlier during the Bush administration.,68
1246,"Some of them were talking to the journalists that didn't, you know, maybe it's alleged.",87
1247,I want to put them on the spot.,31
1248,Maybe they deny it.,19
1249,Maybe they don't leave that to them.,36
1250,"But somebody somewhere was informing this reporting, right, that got into the New York times about the Bush era warrantless wiretapping program.",144
1251,"And eventually, journalists put this out there.",47
1252,People knew these capabilities existed.,39
1253,"But yeah, then there's the person in the YouTube comments, it's like, oh, we knew all about this.",97
1254,This is nothing new.,20
1255,"And the thing is, you can know about some programs and not know about others.",77
1256,You can have a suspicion.,25
1257,You can know with a certainty that this stuff is capable or is as possible to capability exist.,95
1258,You can know that the government has done this stuff in the past.,65
1259,You can know they are likely to do it again.,44
1260,You can have all these indications.,35
1261,"You can have like the Jewel versus NSA case that's run by the EFF, which is about the 18, or it's about AT&T setting up secret rooms in their telecommunications facilities, where they basically drag all the fibers for their domestic internet communications and like phone communications into a room that's purpose-built for the NSA.",332
1262,And then they bring it out.,27
1263,But AT&T is nice.,17
1264,It's the NSA.,13
1265,The NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all.,64
1266,"And so this is the context you say you know, and you know, let's put it the other way.",86
1267,Maybe you do know.,18
1268,Maybe you are an academic researcher.,37
1269,Maybe you're a technological specialist.,40
1270,Maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know.,77
1271,"You can't prove it, but you know this is going on.",50
1272,But that's the thing in a democracy.,36
1273,The distance between speculation and fact.,42
1274,The distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model of government.,132
1275,Because what you know doesn't matter.,37
1276,What matters is what we all know.,33
1277,And the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it.,64
1278,"If you can prove it and if you don't have the evidence, you can't prove it.",75
1279,"And of course, when we talk about the earlier stuff, right, like this, a more corporatized media, they've got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff.",166
1280,They need access to the White House.,36
1281,"They need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews, right?",75
1282,That's constant content that they need.,39
1283,That's access that they need.,29
1284,They need to be taken seriously.,32
1285,They need to be admitted to briefers.,37
1286,It is a co-dependent relationship.,34
1287,"And yet, rather, and so, the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together, right?",116
1288,"If we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence, right?",61
1289,"A body of facts that is so large and so persuasive, it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of these more corporatized media groups.",147
1290,"It overcomes the political and partisan sort of loyalties that all of these political factions in the country do where they go, you know, it's my president.",156
1291,"Even if I don't like this stuff, even if I don't agree with this stuff, I don't want to say it exists.",102
1292,"I want to deny it until it's proved, you know, in HD on video, you know, signing the order to do this or that or the other.",123
1293,"Because otherwise, this is a chance my guy might not get reelected.",67
1294,And that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen.,54
1295,"And the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove this, like the moments in history where we do prove something, anything, beyond a reasonable doubt, are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers.",237
1296,"And I think that's one of the problems that we have, particularly in the climate movement.",90
1297,"Did you look, go ahead.",23
1298,"I'm sorry, did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama, when he was running for office and in his hope and change website, he had provisions to protect whistleblowers and provisions to reward people, right?",211
1299,"I mean, do you remember all that?",33
1300,"I mean, it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website.",77
1301,But that disappeared it from the website.,41
1302,"Yes, but that was a big part of his program or what he was running on was that when people were exposing unlawful activity, he was going to protect those people.",161
1303,Did you take any comfort in that?,33
1304,"Well, Obama also during his campaign said he campaigned actively against the warrantless water tapping the bush administration.",127
1305,"Because remember, Bush is in the scandal, the height of this in 2007.",69
1306,"You know, the elections coming up right after.",46
1307,"And he's going, Obama's saying, you know, that's not who we are.",64
1308,That's not what we do.,22
1309,"And yet, within a hundred days of him becoming a president, now he's sitting in that chair, rather than extinguishing these programs, he embraces them and expands.",163
1310,Why do you think that is?,25
1311,That is.,8
1312,"I think it's actually, again, what we talked about earlier.",59
1313,"First thing, every time a new president comes into the White House, they get their clearances, right?",101
1314,They get read into all this stuff.,34
1315,"During the campaign, they get clearances and they get read into that stuff.",75
1316,"But when they finally become president, right, now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the covert action findings and things like that.",158
1317,"Which are basically, you know, the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody.",88
1318,"They want to run this illegal program here, there, or everywhere.",65
1319,And they can't do it because they're executive agencies without that top level executive sign off.,98
1320,"And so they got to open the vest, right?",40
1321,They got to get these guys on on side.,38
1322,And basically every president sends Kennedy.,44
1323,"They have been successful in what they call fearing up, where as soon as they come in, they read you the litany of horbals and they go, these are all the threats that we're facing.",180
1324,And let's be real.,18
1325,It is a dangerous world.,24
1326,It's not just all made up BS.,29
1327,"Some of it is, right, where it's inflated.",42
1328,"It's not that it's completely false, but they make it sound more serious than it actually is.",93
1329,But there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things.,77
1330,And you have just gone through a hellish election because our electoral politics are so diseased.,97
1331,"And now, after you've crawled through fire, you're already thinking four years ahead.",85
1332,"You know, how do I stay in this seat?",37
1333,"And these guys are basically saying, if you don't do X, Y, and Z, this is going to fall on your lap.",100
1334,"And the implication, which I don't think they actually say, but every president knows, is these guys can undermine you to death.",128
1335,"If you've got the IC against you, right, they can stonewall you, they can put out stories that are going to be problematic for you.",131
1336,"Every day, your presidency.",27
1337,"And it's not that it's necessarily going to catch you out of the White House, but it's a problem that as a president, you very much don't want.",143
1338,"So in the most charitable interpretation of this, you've got a new guy coming in.",81
1339,"In Obama's case, this is a pretty young guy.",44
1340,Doesn't focus in this kind of national security forum policy stuff throughout his earlier career.,97
1341,"He's more interested in domestic policy, you know, he's has been.",65
1342,That's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama.,69
1343,He's just trying to make things better at home.,47
1344,"And now suddenly they go, look, you need to worry about this country.",69
1345,You need to worry about this group that you've never heard of.,62
1346,"You need to worry about, you know, this technology, you need to do all this stuff.",82
1347,And the only reason we can tell you this stuff.,47
1348,"And the only things dividing America and the Abyss are these terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible programs.",109
1349,Right?,6
1350,That are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness.,70
1351,And so here's the real problem.,31
1352,"Every president here is that and every president, you know, first off, they've got so many other things to do is they just kind of nod their head and they'll go, I'll deal with this later in my administration.",209
1353,And this is one of the ironies.,31
1354,"When I came forward in 2013, right, this is now Barack Obama's second term president.",85
1355,"One of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance scandal was yes, we think they went a little too far.",113
1356,"This is after the initial thing where they went, nobody's listening to your phone calls, you know.",98
1357,Just made a data.,17
1358,"Right, nobody, nobody can have a perfect privacy and also have perfect security.",80
1359,So we got to sort of divide a line here between the Constitution and you know what the government wants to do.,110
1360,But they said we were going to get to it.,41
1361,"We know these programs were problematic, but if they just gave us more time, we would have fixed them.",102
1362,"Maybe it's true, right?",23
1363,"Seems awful convenient in hindsight that throughout the entirety of the first term, it seems like what you would say if you got caught.",135
1364,"Right, right, right.",20
1365,"But look, if we're being the most generous that we are here, the president is briefed on real and legitimate threats and they scare the hell out of them.",153
1366,I'm sure.,9
1367,"And we can, we can all imagine being there, right?",50
1368,Those of us who remember what the world was like post 9-11 fears a powerful thing.,82
1369,"But the guys who are doing that briefing, they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years.",122
1370,This is the oldest thing they've given this briefing times before.,66
1371,"You know, when we talk about people talk about the deep state, right?",69
1372,They talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people.,57
1373,It's not that it's something much simpler.,42
1374,The deep state is simply the career government.,47
1375,It's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and outlast presidents.,79
1376,Right?,6
1377,"They've seen Republicans, they've seen Democrats, they don't really care.",73
1378,And they give that same briefing again and again and they get good at it.,73
1379,They know what they want.,25
1380,They know what this person's saying.,36
1381,"Whereas the president, they don't know who these people are.",60
1382,"These people have been there before the president, they're going to be there after the president.",97
1383,"And so they give this very effective, very fear-inducing speech.",64
1384,"And then they follow it up with their asks, which are really demands, just politely provided.",93
1385,"And anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff, who is not ready for this sort of trade-off, and who you have to understand as a career politician, is entirely used to the horse trading game, right?",214
1386,"And they'll deal with this later or not now or what are the, this is the cost benefit here.",91
1387,"And the intelligence community goes, if you give us what we want, no one will ever know about it because it's classified, it's obviously the easy answer.",153
1388,And maybe Barack Obama honestly did want to get to this later.,62
1389,"But what we can say today is, for all the good that may have been done in that White House, this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem, but in fact made it worse.",212
1390,"Well, it seems like the president has a job that's absolutely impossible.",73
1391,"And if you come across someone who has been in the position, someone who's the head of an intelligence agency for a long time, and is very persuasive and has some legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job, but he tells you this is important for national security.",285
1392,We need to keep these things in place.,38
1393,It doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implementing.,134
1394,It seems completely unrealistic.,32
1395,"And the job itself, it just, it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately.",82
1396,"And when it comes to something like this mass or valent state, I could see a president being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says, this is why we need to do this.",172
1397,"Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I think is the underlying problem and everything that you just described as the president has too much power.",146
1398,Right.,6
1399,"And because they have too much power, that means they have too much responsibility.",83
1400,"And I don't think people understand if they haven't lived outside the United States if they haven't sort of traveled or studied broadly, just how exceptional the American presidency is, most countries don't have a single individual with this level of power.",257
1401,It's really only the super states.,34
1402,"And that may be by design, perhaps, that's why they're super states.",68
1403,"But when we look at sort of complex advanced democracies that are more peaceful, they tend to have a more multilaterally system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios.",180
1404,And a lot of this derives from just the size of the government.,63
1405,"Like you said, you know, the president is responsible for basically everything executive branch and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually does any work.",175
1406,"And so how do you, how do you correct for that without breaking it up where you have smaller ministers and ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility, having a smaller government overall?",221
1407,"You know, back in 1776, the federal government, you know, was pretty much a dream.",82
1408,We weren't even interested in having standing armies.,53
1409,The idea of an army that existed from year to year was terrifying for bidding thing.,84
1410,"And then when you moved this idea that we have a president that they have these extraordinary powers, it's okay because the government is very small.",149
1411,"The federal government, especially, is seen as sort of this small and toothless and weak thing.",95
1412,He paused for one second.,25
1413,Pause for one second because my air pods are about to die and I'm going to swap over to another pair.,101
1414,"These, these sucks are good for a couple hours, but we're two hours and 15 minutes here.",88
1415,"We'll have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it, but Jamie, Jamie will take care of it.",111
1416,"I wanted to talk about you, like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this.",99
1417,Because you've been an exile for how many years now?,52
1418,It's been more than six years now.,34
1419,Six years of 2013.,18
1420,"Yeah, I mean, well, actually, I left May.",41
1421,So what is life like?,21
1422,Are you in constant hiding?,27
1423,"I mean, what are the issues like?",33
1424,"In the beginning, my operational security level, as we would call it, was very high.",84
1425,"I was concerned about being recognized, I was concerned about being followed, I was concerned, really, about very bad things happening to me.",141
1426,"Because the government made it very clear that from their position, I was the most wanted man in the world.",107
1427,"They literally brought down the president of Bolivia, his aircraft, and would not let it depart, as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe, not even the United States.",169
1428,They wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board.,67
1429,"So yeah, that made me a little bit nervous, but you can't live like that forever.",81
1430,"And although I was as careful as I could be, I still lived pretty happily, because I was an indoor cat to begin with.",117
1431,I've always been a technologist.,32
1432,I've always been pretty nerdy.,30
1433,"So as long as I have a screen and an internet connection, I was pretty happy.",77
1434,"But in the years past, my life has become more and more open.",61
1435,"I speak openly, I live openly, I go out, I ride the metro, I go to restaurants, I go, you know, how often I recognize.",118
1436,"So this is a funny thing, as I'm almost never recognized.",57
1437,"One of those things is I don't give Russian interviews, because I don't want my face all over the news, which is nice, because it just allows people to sort of forget about my face.",181
1438,And I can go about my life.,27
1439,"But it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year, even when I'm not wearing my glasses, in a museum or a grocery store or something like that or out on the street.",189
1440,"Just by somebody who I swear, like these people, you might have read a story about them like super recognizers, the people just have a great memory for faces.",158
1441,Because I can be like aware in a hood and like a jacket can have a scarf around my face like in the winter.,107
1442,And like you can barely see my face.,36
1443,"And they'll come up to me and they're like, are you snowing?",60
1444,"And I'm like, whoa.",19
1445,What are you saying?,20
1446,That's pretty impressive.,25
1447,I'd say yeah.,13
1448,Wow.,4
1449,It's nice to meet you.,22
1450,"And yeah, I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized.",70
1451,"But for me, because I'm a privacy advocate, I would much rather go unrecognized, like I don't want to be a celebrity.",117
1452,"But the other thing is, I'll get recognized in computer stores.",63
1453,"And I think there's just like a mental association where people are like their brain, when it's cycling through faces that are recognized, it's going through like the subset of nerdy or people or something like that when you're in a computer store.",248
1454,"Because for whatever reason, I recognize much more frequently when there's some kind of technological like locusts.",115
1455,So you're living freely.,24
1456,You had to learn Russian.,25
1457,Did you learn it?,17
1458,"Yeah, I mean, my Russian is still pretty crappy to my great shame because all of my life, all of my work is primarily English.",126
1459,Right.,6
1460,Right.,6
1461,"Now, you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial.",70
1462,"Is that a feasible thing, a fair trial for someone like you?",60
1463,Is that such a... Well.,23
1464,Is that even possible?,22
1465,It's a good question.,21
1466,"I mean, look, if we're being frank, I think all your audience knows, the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern District of Virginia, a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA, is probably pretty slim, because that's where they draw the jury pool from.",268
1467,Right.,6
1468,But my objection here is on a larger principle.,47
1469,What happens to me is less important.,37
1470,"If I spend the rest of my life in jail, that's less important.",62
1471,"Then what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to, which is a single thing.",85
1472,Right.,6
1473,"They say, face the music, face the music, and I'm saying, great.",64
1474,Let's pick the song.,20
1475,"The thing is, the law that I've been charged under, the one that all these whistleblowers have been charged on, or Thomas Drake, Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, Daniel Hale, the drone whistleblower who is in prison right now, going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing.",302
1476,"His lawyer is asking the court, or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did.",106
1477,"That the government is violating laws, the government is violating human rights, that these programs are immoral, that they're unethical.",137
1478,This is what motivated this guy to do it.,41
1479,"The jury should be able to hear why he did what he did, and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong.",126
1480,"The government has responded to this whistleblower argument, basically, saying, we demand the court forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court.",163
1481,He cannot talk about what motivated him.,40
1482,"He cannot talk about what was revealed, why it was revealed, what the impacts and effects were.",95
1483,"He can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it, because it doesn't matter.",104
1484,"Now, this might surprise a lot of people, because to a lot of us, we think that's what a jury trial is.",103
1485,We think that's what a fair trial is.,37
1486,"But the espionage act that the government uses against whistleblowers, meaning broadly here, the sources of journalism, is fairly unique in the legal system, in that it is what's called a strict liability crime.",211
1487,"A strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder, because if you murdered somebody, like if you just, I don't know, beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now, you would be able to go to the court and say it was self-defense, right?",287
1488,You felt threatened.,20
1489,"You were in danger for your life, even if you weren't, even if you obviously weren't, even if you were on tape, you could still argue that, and the jury could go, you full of crap, right?",187
1490,And they could convict you.,27
1491,"But if you were, in fact, acting in self-defense, if the jury did, in fact, believe you, they could take that into consideration and establish from their verdict, right?",169
1492,Strict liability crimes forbid that.,36
1493,The jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime.,62
1494,They're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime.,58
1495,They are not allowed to consider if the murder was justified.,61
1496,They're only allowed to consider if the murder took place.,58
1497,And the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth.,98
1498,"The Espionage Act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth, right?",114
1499,"Like that, that's what it's about in the context of journalism.",63
1500,"They don't bring the Espionage Act against people who lied, then they would use fraud or some other statute.",108
1501,They say the government is arguing in the context of whistle blowing that telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder.,175
1502,"And I believe, and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally, indefensibly wrong.",96
1503,"And so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning was been, I'll be back for a jury trial tomorrow, but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense.",207
1504,It doesn't matter whether they are whistleblower or not.,56
1505,It's just they argued.,22
1506,It's the jury that decides whether they are whistleblower or not.,65
1507,They have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did.,82
1508,The government says we refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions.,142
1509,Wow.,4
1510,So you have had these conversations then.,41
1511,So this has been discussed.,27
1512,"Oh, no, this is from the Obama administration.",46
1513,"There's been no contact since the Trump administration because the government basically, when they got to this point, they went, we have no good argument against this.",167
1514,And we will never permit this to happen.,40
1515,"And again, I just want to make clear this is not speculation.",61
1516,This is not me thinking.,24
1517,This is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale right now.,64
1518,"I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for it because this story just at the papers, like two or three weeks ago, saying the government is forbidding this guy from making this argument.",184
1519,So you're sitting here seemingly in a state of limbo then you're they're not actively pursuing you.,99
1520,"It seems that if you're able to move around freely, they haven't discovered where you are.",90
1521,You're just free to live your life.,35
1522,"You well, yeah.",15
1523,Yeah.,5
1524,"I mean, it's one of these things where you know, whether they they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am, where I put my head on the pill.",154
1525,It doesn't matter so much.,26
1526,"I'm in Russia, right?",21
1527,"And we should lean into that because I think people, they hear Russia, particularly in the context of today's news and you see like what people are saying about Tulsi Gabbard and things like that.",196
1528,Yeah.,5
1529,"Any kind of association any any time your name appears in the same sentence, same paragraph same story is the word Russia.",122
1530,It's considered a negative thing now.,37
1531,And don't get me wrong.,23
1532,I've been a long time critic of the Russian government.,55
1533,I just actually had a major story written about me in a Russian state news outlet called re-in-the-vosti.,105
1534,You guys could could probably pull it.,38
1535,It's only in Russian though.,28
1536,"That's saying because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition, Alexei Navalny, which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy.",153
1537,"I was saying, look, I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country.",89
1538,And they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation in the future because the background here is this opposition figure has been a long time form in the Russian administration side.,192
1539,And they've just suddenly magically been accused of being foreign agents or something like that.,96
1540,"And so everyone connected to this, which is like a big civil society body, had their doors like simultaneously kicked in across the country and they're being investigated for some kind of corruption or something.",212
1541,It doesn't even matter.,23
1542,"And I said, I oppose that.",26
1543,"Just like I was tweeting footage of a ballot stuffing in the Russian elections, just like I've criticized the Russian president by name.",136
1544,I've criticized Russian surveillance laws.,42
1545,There's so many things again and again and again and again.,59
1546,"But yeah, so look, it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose.",100
1547,And people don't remember this.,31
1548,"I was actually en route to Latin America when the US government canceled my passport, which trapped me in Russia.",113
1549,"And for those who are interested again, I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this.",96
1550,"But yeah, it's difficult to be basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government.",156
1551,"And it's a hard thing, you know, and it's not a happy thing, but I feel like it's a necessary thing.",100
1552,The problem is nobody wants to talk about that.,47
1553,Nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance.,46
1554,Nobody wants to consider those kind of conversations in the current world.,74
1555,"People believe, and this is actually one of the worst things that Western media does in the context of discussing Russia, is they create this or even invincibility around the Russian president.",193
1556,"And this guy's calling all the shots, he's pulling on the strings, you know, this guy's in charge of the world.",111
1557,"And that's very useful for the Russian government broadly, because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media and they're going to go look how strong we are.",178
1558,"You know, the Americans are afraid of us.",41
1559,The Chinese are afraid of us.,29
1560,Everybody's afraid of us.,25
1561,The French are afraid of us.,28
1562,We are strong.,14
1563,Right.,6
1564,There's no question that Russia is going to be interfering in elections.,72
1565,There's no question that America is going to be interfering in Russian elections.,81
1566,Right.,6
1567,Nobody likes to talk about this.,32
1568,"And again, I need to substantiate that now that I've said that I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times.",117
1569,"The New York Times publishes a story in the wake of, you know, this contest in 2016 election, where they looked into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet Union.",186
1570,"And they found in roughly 50 years, 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets.",105
1571,Right.,6
1572,This is not a new thing.,24
1573,This is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do.,83
1574,"That's what they think they're being paid for, which is a sad thing, but it's a, it's a reality because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering.",180
1575,"But in that same study that they found 36 different cases by the Russians and the Soviets, they found 81 different cases by the US.",131
1576,And this was published by Scott Shane and the New York Times and both the Washington Post as well.,98
1577,"But this is, this is the thing like there is a way to criticize.",64
1578,So the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life.,135
1579,They just want to do better.,28
1580,They want the same things that you do.,38
1581,Right.,6
1582,"And every time people go, oh, Russia, Russia, Russia, every time people go Russia bad, every time they go Russia is doing this, they go Russia is doing that.",157
1583,Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that.,82
1584,Like do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump?,55
1585,Like do you want to be have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck?,67
1586,"And then people go, oh, well, you know, you could overthrow Donald Trump, you know, you could overthrow Putin.",110
1587,Can you really?,15
1588,Like is that how it works?,26
1589,"So yeah, I mean, look, I have no affiliation.",45
1590,I have no love for the Russian government.,42
1591,It's not my choice to be here.,30
1592,And I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home.,60
1593,Is there any concern that they would deny you visa?,51
1594,"I mean, how are you staying there?",34
1595,It's a good question.,21
1596,So I have a permanent residence.,32
1597,"People think I'm under silent, but I'm no longer under it.",58
1598,It's like a green card now.,27
1599,It's got to be renewed every three years.,41
1600,"So yeah, sure, it's possible they could kick me out.",52
1601,And this was what the story I was telling you about before Russian media was.,77
1602,"They were saying, you know, the Russian government should take some action against me.",86
1603,Or I shouldn't be welcome here.,31
1604,I should go home because why is he criticizing the Russian government?,70
1605,Right when they're the people?,30
1606,Is that like the Russian version of Fox News?,45
1607,I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you.,52
1608,"I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or associate press, but the helifine home.",90
1609,But the thing is this.,22
1610,What's the alternative?,23
1611,Right?,6
1612,"Yes, the Russian government could screw me, but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything.",98
1613,And so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are injustices?,87
1614,Because it makes me safer.,26
1615,"Well, a lot of pragmatic people say, yeah, they say you've done enough.",71
1616,They say you've done your part.,31
1617,"Whatever, be safe, live long, be happy.",39
1618,But I didn't come forward to be safe.,37
1619,"If I wanted to be safe, I'd still be sitting in Hawaii, making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you.",109
1620,Right?,6
1621,And nobody ever would have known about this.,44
1622,The system would have gotten worse.,35
1623,"But the system, the world, the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about it.",95
1624,"Every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see, the world gets worse.",84
1625,"And yeah, it's risky.",21
1626,"Yeah, it's uncomfortable.",25
1627,But that's why we do it.,24
1628,"Because if we don't, no one else will.",38
1629,"All those years I was sitting, hoping for someone else to come forward.",71
1630,And no one did.,15
1631,Right?,6
1632,That's because I was waiting for a hero.,40
1633,But there are no heroes.,24
1634,Right?,6
1635,There's only heroic decisions.,30
1636,You are never further than one decision away from making a difference.,70
1637,"It doesn't matter whether it's a big difference, doesn't matter if it was a small difference because you don't have to save the world by yourself.",146
1638,"In fact, you can't.",19
1639,All you have to do is lay down one brick.,41
1640,All you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way.,69
1641,So other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside that.,66
1642,"And together, step by step day by day, year by year, we build the foundation of something better.",97
1643,"But yeah, it's not going to be safe, but it doesn't matter because individually, it's not, you know, me, whoever you are, it's the iron man.",140
1644,"Well, I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans.",82
1645,"If the world ends, it's going to affect you.",44
1646,We make things better.,22
1647,We become safe together.,24
1648,Right?,6
1649,"Collectively, that is our strength.",35
1650,That is the power of civilization.,34
1651,That is the power that shapes the future.,41
1652,"Because even if you make life great for you, you're going to die someday.",73
1653,You're going to be forgotten someday.,37
1654,Your cans of beans are going to rot someday.,44
1655,You can make things safe.,25
1656,"You can be more careful, right?",31
1657,You can be more clever and there's nothing wrong with that.,59
1658,"But at the end of the day, you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life, what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life.",178
1659,You're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom.,89
1660,You've lost the ability to act because you were afraid.,55
1661,That's a beautiful way to put it.,33
1662,That's a beautiful way to put it.,33
1663,Are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance and what if anything has changed since your revelations?,114
1664,"Yeah, I mean, the big thing that's changed since I was in 2013 is now it's mobile first, everything.",100
1665,"Mobile was still a big deal, right?",35
1666,And the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it.,102
1667,"But now people are much less likely to use laptop than use a desktop than use, you know, God, any kind of wired phone, then they are to use a smartphone.",153
1668,"And both Apple and Android devices, unfortunately, are not especially good in protecting your privacy.",102
1669,Think right now.,16
1670,"You got a smartphone, right?",28
1671,"You might be listening to this on a train somewhere in traffic right now, or you Joe right now, you got a phone somewhere in the room, right?",141
1672,The phone is turned off or at least the screen is turned off.,61
1673,It's sitting there.,19
1674,It's powered on.,16
1675,"And if somebody sends you a message, the screen blinks to life.",63
1676,How does that happen?,21
1677,Right.,6
1678,How is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number your phone rings and nobody else's rings?,111
1679,"How is it that you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings, right?",84
1680,"Every smartphone, every phone at all, is constantly connected to the nearest cellular power.",92
1681,"Every phone, even when the screen is off, you think it's doing nothing.",71
1682,You can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible.,65
1683,"It's screaming in the air saying, here I am.",44
1684,Here I am.,10
1685,Here is my IMEI.,16
1686,I think it's individual manufacturers equipment identity.,57
1687,"And IMEI, individual manufacturers, subscriber identity.",56
1688,"I could be wrong on the breakout there, but the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI.",83
1689,And you can search for these things.,36
1690,"There are two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place, right?",100
1691,It makes your phone different than all the other phones.,56
1692,The IMEI is burned into the handset of your phone.,50
1693,"No matter what SIM card you change to, it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network.",126
1694,It's this physical handset.,27
1695,"The IMESI is in your SIM card, right?",37
1696,"And this is what holds your phone number, right?",48
1697,"It's basically the key, the right to use that phone number.",59
1698,"And so your phone is sitting there doing nothing, you think, but it's constantly shouting and saying, I'm here.",111
1699,Who is closest to me?,21
1700,That's the cell phone tower.,28
1701,"And every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going, all right, I see Joe Rogan's phone, right?",143
1702,"I see Jamie's phone, I see all these phones that are here right now.",68
1703,"And it compares notes with the other network towers and your smartphone compares notes with them to go, who do I hear the loudest?",130
1704,"And who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity, for closeness distance, right?",85
1705,"They go, whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else, that's close to me.",74
1706,"So you're going to be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone tower is going to make a note, a permanent record saying this phone, this phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me, right?",224
1707,"And based on your phone handset and your phone number, they can get your identity, right?",89
1708,Because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that.,78
1709,"And even if you don't, right, it's still active at your house overnight, it's still active, you know, on your nightstand when you're sleeping, it's still whatever.",163
1710,"The movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person and those are often quite uniquely identifying it goes to your home, it goes to your workplace, other people don't have it, sorry.",195
1711,"And anyway, it's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other parts of network.",105
1712,"And when somebody is trying to get to a phone, it compares notes of the network compares notes to go, where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now?",168
1713,"And to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone, it sends out a signal saying, we have a call for you.",113
1714,Make your phone start ringing so your owner can answer it and then it connects it across this whole path.,105
1715,"But what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone, whenever the phone is turned on, there's a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies.",187
1716,"It does not need to be kept forever and in fact there's no good argument for it to be kept forever but these companies see that as valuable information, right?",159
1717,"This is the whole big data problem that we're running into and all this information that used to be a femoral, right?",117
1718,"Where were you when you were eight years old, you know, where were you, where'd you go after you had a bad breakup?",115
1719,"You know, who'd you spend the night with?",41
1720,Who'd you call after?,21
1721,"All this information used to be a femoral, meaning it disappeared, right?",73
1722,"Like the morning dew, it would be gone.",39
1723,No one would remember it.,25
1724,But now these things are stored.,32
1725,Now these things are saved.,27
1726,"It doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong, it doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on earth.",122
1727,"Because that's how bulk collection, which is the government's ephemism for mass surveillance, works.",100
1728,They simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful.,81
1729,And that was just talking about how you connect to the phone network.,69
1730,"That's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently, right?",114
1731,How do you get a text message notification?,43
1732,How do you get an email notification?,37
1733,How is it the Facebook knows where you're at?,45
1734,"You know, all of these things, these analytics, they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone through GPS, through even just what wireless access points you're connected to, because there's a global constantly updated map.",246
1735,"There's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world, because just like we talked about, every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique, every wireless access point in the world, right?",213
1736,"You cable-mode them at home, whether it's in your laptop, every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it.",133
1737,"And this is standard term, you can look it up.",46
1738,"And these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air, because again, like your phone says to the cell phone tower, I have this identifier, the cell phone tower responds and says, I have this identifier.",217
1739,"And anybody who's listening, they can write these things down.",62
1740,"And all those Google Street View cars that go back and forth, right?",68
1741,"They're keeping notes on whose Wi-Fi is active on this block, right?",68
1742,And then they build a new giant map.,36
1743,"So even if you have GPS turned off, right?",42
1744,"As long as you connect to Wi-Fi, those apps can go, well, I'm connected to Joe's Wi-Fi, but I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here, and the other one in this apartment over here, and the other one in the apartment here, and you should only be able to hear those for globally unique Wi-Fi access points from these points in physical space, right?",347
1745,"The intersection in between the spreads, the domes of all those wireless access points, and it's a proxy for location.",118
1746,And it just goes on and on and on.,34
1747,We can talk about this for four more hours.,43
1748,We don't have that kind of time.,32
1749,So I'm going to ask you this.,29
1750,Is there a way to mitigate any of this personally?,50
1751,"I mean, is shutting your phone off doesn't even work, right?",60
1752,"Well, so it does in a way.",26
1753,It's yes and no.,16
1754,"The thing with shutting your phone off that is a risk is, how do you know your phone's actually turned off?",107
1755,"It used to be when I was in Geneva, for example, working for the CIA, we would all carry like drug dealer phones, you know, the old smartphones, or old dumb phones, they're not smartphones.",189
1756,"And the reason why was just because they had removed all the battery bags where you could take the battery out, right?",118
1757,"And the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it, right?",87
1758,"If there's no go juice available to it, if there's no battery connected to it, it's not sending anything because you have to get power from somewhere.",150
1759,You have to have power in order to do work.,43
1760,"But now your phones are all sealed, right?",42
1761,You can't take the batteries out.,33
1762,"So there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off, but it's not actually off.",108
1763,"It's just pretending to be off, whereas in fact, it's still listening in and doing all this stuff.",98
1764,"But for the average person, that doesn't apply, right?",54
1765,"And I got to tell you guys, they've been chasing me all over the place.",71
1766,"I don't worry about that stuff, right?",38
1767,"And it's because if they are applying that level of effort to me, they'll probably get the same information through other routes.",129
1768,"I am as careful as I can and I use things like Faraday cages, I turn devices off.",81
1769,"But if they're actually manipulating the way devices display, it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis.",161
1770,"Also, if they get me, I only trust phones so much.",50
1771,So there's only so much they can derive from the compromise.,60
1772,And this is how operational security works.,43
1773,You think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate?,97
1774,"And the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss, what would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hacks, right?",221
1775,Which are like next level stuff.,32
1776,And actually just a shout out for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff.,89
1777,I wrote a paper on this specific problem.,41
1778,How do you know on a phone is actually off?,43
1779,How do you know when it's actually not spying on you?,53
1780,"With a brilliant, brilliant guy named Andrew Bunning-Wong.",58
1781,He's an MIT PhD and I think electrical engineering.,51
1782,He's called the introspection engine that was published in the Journal of Open Engineering.,91
1783,You can find it online.,23
1784,And it'll go as deep down in the weeds I promise you as you want.,65
1785,We take an iPhone 6.,20
1786,This was back when it was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state but physically moderate state to see if it was spying on you.,183
1787,"But for average people right, this is academic.",47
1788,That's not your primary threat.,31
1789,Your primary threats are these bulk collection programs.,56
1790,Your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers is doing all of these things.,128
1791,Because we leave our phones and a state that is constantly on.,62
1792,"You're constantly connected, right?",35
1793,Airplane mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore.,57
1794,It just turns off the cellular mode.,36
1795,But the whole idea is we need to identify the problem.,54
1796,And the central problem with smartphone used today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time.,114
1797,Like the phone has the screen off.,34
1798,You don't know what it's connected to.,38
1799,You don't know how frequently it's doing it.,44
1800,Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device.,122
1801,"And to intermediate them going, I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now.",83
1802,"You know, I don't want Google to be able to talk right now.",59
1803,I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk.,55
1804,I just want my weather app to be able to talk.,46
1805,But I just check my weather and now I'm done with it.,53
1806,So I don't want that to be able to talk anymore.,48
1807,And we need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis but a connection by connection basis.,128
1808,"You want, let's say you use Facebook because you know, for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it.",113
1809,You want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers.,64
1810,You want to be able to message a friend.,40
1811,You want to be able to download a photograph or whatever.,57
1812,But you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server.,57
1813,You don't want it to talk to an analytics server that's modern behavior.,72
1814,Right.,6
1815,You don't want to talk to all these third party things because Facebook crams their garbage.,92
1816,And almost every app that you download and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see it.,105
1817,Right.,6
1818,And this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible.,124
1819,"And what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices, whether it's a phone, whether it's computer, whatever.",127
1820,More visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it.,89
1821,So like if you could see your phone right now.,46
1822,"And at the very center of it is a little green icon that's your, you know, handset or it's a picture of your face, whatever.",124
1823,And then you see all these little spokes coming off of it that's every app that your phone is talking to right now.,115
1824,Or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that it's connecting to and you can see right now once every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook.,182
1825,"And you could just poke that app and then boom, it's not talking to Facebook anymore.",85
1826,Facebook's not allowed.,23
1827,Facebook's speaking privileges have been revoked.,49
1828,Right.,6
1829,You would do that.,18
1830,We would all do that.,21
1831,"If there was a button on your phone that said, do what I want, but not spy on me.",81
1832,You would press that button.,28
1833,Right.,6
1834,"That button does not exist right now and both Google and Apple, unfortunately, Apple is a lot better at this than Google.",121
1835,But neither of them allow that button to exist.,47
1836,"In fact, they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk.",79
1837,"And from a particular perspective, they actually aren't wrong there.",68
1838,But it's not enough to go.,26
1839,"You know, we have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions.",117
1840,We think it's too complicated for people to do this.,52
1841,We think there's too many connections being made.,49
1842,"Well, that is actually a confession of the problem right there.",63
1843,If you think people can't understand it.,40
1844,"If you think there are too many communications happening, if you think there's too much complexity in there, it needs to be simplified.",135
1845,Just like the president can't control everything like that.,59
1846,"If you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government, we have a problem guys.",129
1847,This should be a much more simple process.,42
1848,It should be obvious.,21
1849,And the fact that it's not.,27
1850,"And the fact that we read story after story, year after year, saying all your data been breached here.",102
1851,This company's spying on you here.,34
1852,This company's manipulating your purchases or your search results or they're hiding these things from your timeline or they're influencing you or manipulating it in all of these different ways.,193
1853,That happens as a result of a single problem.,45
1854,And that problem is in any quality of available information.,60
1855,They can see everything about you.,34
1856,They can see everything about what your device is doing and they can do whatever they want with your device.,108
1857,"You, on the other hand, owned the device.",41
1858,"Well, rather you paid for the device.",37
1859,But increasingly these corporations own it.,43
1860,Increasingly these governments own it.,38
1861,And increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work.,67
1862,We pay all the taxes.,21
1863,We pay all the costs.,21
1864,But we own less and less.,25
1865,And nobody understands this better than the youngest generation.,64
1866,"Well, it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was.",81
1867,It became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms.,106
1868,"Before we understood what we were giving up, they were making billions of dollars.",82
1869,"And then once that money is being earned and once everyone's accustomed to the situation, it's very difficult to pull the reins back.",133
1870,It's very difficult to turn that horse around.,46
1871,"It precisely because the money then becomes power, right?",57
1872,The information then becomes influence.,39
1873,That also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance states.,103
1874,"Once they have the access, it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that.",93
1875,Right.,6
1876,Yeah.,5
1877,"No, you're you're exactly correct.",34
1878,And this is the subject of the book.,36
1879,"I mean, this is this is the permanent record.",45
1880,And this is where it came from.,31
1881,This is how it came to exist.,29
1882,"The story of our lifetimes is how intentionally by design a number of institutions, both governmental and corporate, realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through society.",306
1883,"Remember back in the day intelligence collection in the United States, even at SIGIN used to mean sending an FBI agent, right, to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in somebody disguised as a workman.",219
1884,"And they put a bug in a building or they built a satellite listening site, right?",81
1885,We called these foreign sat or foreign satellite collection.,60
1886,We're on the desert somewhere they built a big parabolic collector.,67
1887,"And it's just listening to satellite emissions, right?",54
1888,"But these satellite emissions, these satellite links were owned by militaries.",78
1889,"They were exclusive to governments, right?",42
1890,It wasn't affecting everybody broadly.,38
1891,"Also, valence was targeted because it had to be.",48
1892,What changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate.,82
1893,It could become a dragnet.,26
1894,"It could become bulk collection, which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency.",128
1895,"But we were intentionally, this was intentionally concealed from us, right?",75
1896,The government did it.,22
1897,They used classification.,25
1898,Companies did it.,17
1899,They intentionally didn't talk about it.,40
1900,They denied these things were going.,36
1901,"They said, you agreed to this and you didn't agree to nothing like this.",72
1902,"I'm sorry, right?",17
1903,"They go, we put that terms of service page up and you clicked that you clicked a button that said, I agree because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends.",184
1904,You were trying to get driving directions.,42
1905,You were trying to get an email account.,40
1906,You weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form.,56
1907,"Even if you read, you wouldn't understand.",42
1908,"It doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs and it said, this agreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company.",190
1909,They have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us.,74
1910,Do not belong to us.,20
1911,This is sort of one of the core principles on which mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal.,134
1912,"And you have to understand that all the stuff we talk about today, government says everything they do is legal, right?",118
1913,And they go so it's fine.,25
1914,"Our perspectives of the public should be, well, that's actually the problem because this is an okay.",100
1915,The scandal isn't how they're breaking the law.,47
1916,The scandals that they don't have to break the law.,51
1917,And the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine.,95
1918,The third party doctrine is a legal principle derived from a case.,66
1919,And I believe the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland.,53
1920,And Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady making phone calls to her house.,91
1921,"And when she would pick up, you just sit there having breathing, whatever like classic creeper.",95
1922,"And you know, it's terrifying this poor lady.",45
1923,"So she calls the cops and says, one day I got one of these phone calls and I see this car creep and pass my house on the street.",128
1924,And she got a license plate number.,35
1925,"So she goes to the cops and she goes, is this the guy?",54
1926,"And the cops, again, they're trying to do a good thing here.",60
1927,"They look up his license plate number and they find out where this guy is and then they go, well, what phone number is registered to that house?",144
1928,"And they go to the phone company and they say, can you give us this record?",75
1929,"And the phone company says, yeah, sure.",39
1930,And it's the guy.,17
1931,"The cops got their man, right?",30
1932,"So they go arrest this guy and then in court, his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go, um, you did this without warrant.",128
1933,That was sorry.,15
1934,"That was, that was the, the problem was, they went to the phone company and they got the records without a warrant.",115
1935,"They just asked for it or they subpoenaed it, right?",52
1936,Some lower standard legal review.,33
1937,And the company gave it to him and got the guy they marched off jail.,69
1938,"And they could have gotten warrant, right?",42
1939,But it was just expedience.,27
1940,They just didn't want to take the time.,39
1941,"Small town cops, you can understand how it happens.",51
1942,They know the guys are creeper.,31
1943,They just want to get them off to jail.,39
1944,And so they made a mistake with the government doesn't want to let go.,70
1945,"They fight on this and they go, uh, it wasn't actually, they weren't his records.",81
1946,"And so because they didn't belong to him, he didn't have a fourth amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them.",121
1947,They were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence no warrant was required because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours.,187
1948,Now here's the problem.,23
1949,"The government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known suspected criminal who had, they had real good reasons to suspect suspect was their guy.",163
1950,And use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent that these records don't belong to the guy.,127
1951,They belong to the company.,27
1952,"And then they said, well, if one person doesn't have a fourth amendment interest in records held by a company, no one does.",123
1953,And so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives.,106
1954,And remember this is back in the 1970s.,39
1955,"You know, the internet hardly exists in these kind of context.",62
1956,"Smartphones, you know, don't exist.",35
1957,"Modern society, modern communications don't exist.",50
1958,This is the very beginning of the technological era.,52
1959,And flash forward now 40 years.,31
1960,"And they are still relying on this precedent about this one, you know, pervig creeper to go, nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company.",158
1961,"And so long as they do that, companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinarily abusive.",128
1962,And this is something that people don't get.,44
1963,"So, oh, well, it's data collection, right?",42
1964,They're exploiting data.,24
1965,This is data about human lives.,31
1966,It is data about people.,24
1967,These records are about you.,28
1968,It's not data that's being exploited.,37
1969,It's people that are being exploited.,37
1970,It's not data that's being manipulated.,39
1971,It's you that's being manipulated.,34
1972,And this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand.,79
1973,"Now, the problem is the companies and the governments are still pretending they don't understand or disagreeing with this.",122
1974,"And this is why my answer me of something that one of my old friends, John Paragbarlo, who served with me at the Freedom of the Press Foundation on the President of the Board, used to say to me, which is, you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep.",260
1975,"He said, it's an old Native American saying that's a great expression.",70
1976,"It's a good way to, I think that's a good way to end this.",58
1977,"Ed, thank you very much for doing this.",39
1978,I really appreciate it.,23
1979,Please tell everybody the title of your book and it's available right now.,74
1980,Sure.,5
1981,"Yes, it is.",11
1982,"It's on shelves everywhere, at least until the government finds some other way to ban it.",89
1983,It is called a permanent record.,32
1984,And I hope you will read it.,28
1985,I will read it.,15
1986,And I think what you've done is incredibly brave.,49
1987,And I think you're a very important part of history.,52
1988,"I think when all is said and done, what you did and what you exposed is going to change the way we view mass surveillance, change the way we view government oversight and change the way we view the distribution of information.",226
1989,"I really think it's very, very important.",41
1990,"And it was an honor to talk to you, man.",40
1991,Thank you.,10
1992,"Oh, it was my pleasure.",23
1993,Thank you so much for having me.,32
1994,"Take care yourself, man.",24
1995,Stay safe.,10
1996,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't stay safe.",52
1997,Stay safe.,10
1998,Open safe.,10
1999,Stay safe.,10
2000,Stay free.,10
2001,Open to possibilities.,22
2002,Take care.,10
2003,Take care.,10
